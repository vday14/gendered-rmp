            "If you like writing, cursing, blasphemy, having fun, and working your tail off, take this class. If you want to inspired to be your best self, take this class. If you value trust, friendship, and universal truths, take this class. English 425 with John was the best three hours of my week every week. I would follow John to the end of the earth.", 
            "TAKE THIS CLASS! John was definitely the best teacher I had at UM-- I was practically crying when I left on the last day of class. He gives incredible feedback and he becomes a life coach. He really teaches you how to use grammar properly and how to write. If I could, I would retake this course in a second. A must take at UM-- he's the best!", 
            "John deeply (+ equally) cares about his students and his craft. You'll learn to write/edit in pursuit of truth and uncovering stories that should be told. The class becomes a senior year community (so precious!), & John cares for his students long past graduation. If you take one class at Michigan -- no matter your major -- take 425 with Rubadeau.", 
            "John's English 325 class was the best class I took in my entire four years in college. The atmosphere he is able to create in the classroom, and the connections that he creates with his students are unparalleled. If you only take one class at the University of Michigan, make it 325 with John.", 
            "John is by far the best teacher at U of M. He is funny, caring, and so passionate. He genuinely loves his job, and makes you want to come to class. Don't go in expecting an A though, you'll have to work for it, but it's worth it, trust me. Go to office hours & put effort into your work, and this will be one of the best classes you've ever had.", 
            "He is truly astounding! He is the best professor I have had at umich!", 
            "I will just say one thing; shut up and take this class.", 
            "Easily the best professor on campus. I was lucky enough to be taught by a handful of Golden Apple professors, but none captivated my like Rubadeau's. The rapport he develops with his students is unmatched, and the relationships he forges last decades. The best piece of advice I can give is to take his class as many times as he lets you.", 
            "The only class I took at UM that I truly adored. I could not wait to get to class each day and that's a testament to John. He creates such a warm, close-knit atmosphere that my class truly became a family. He is such a hilarious, intelligent man who genuinely cares about his students. I wish I hadn't graduated so I could take 425 with him.", 
            "John was incredible. He taught me more about the technical side of writing that I learned from all my other creative writing classes combined. He's funny, class is interesting, and there's always a wait list because so many people have been recommended to take his class. He's seriously the best.", 
            "John is by far the best professor I have EVER had at the University and this is by far the BEST class I have ever taken. As many people said do NOT take this class if you need to get an A. DO take the class if you want to be challenged and not only want to learn more about the english language but also learn more about yourself. John is the BEST!", 
            "Do NOT take John's class if: you think writing is uninteresting, you feel entitled to an \"A\" grade, you can't tolerate cursing, and/or you aren't prepared to work your tail off. Not a class in which one can \"get by on talent.\" That said, 425 was BY FAR the best class I've taken at UM. It exceeded my wildest expectations, and John is a RIOT.", 
            "John is the best professor you'll ever have. He cares deeply about his students and considers them all friends. You will learn a TON, but you'll have to work hard as well. Don't take his class if you want a blow-off upper level writing credit, and don't take his class if you're easily offended by \"scatalogical\" language.", 
            "I miss him! English with John will remind you why you love to learn.", 
            "Take this if you want to learn about writing. There are many reasons why UM's humanities departments receive high rankings by outside evaluation, and John is one of them.", 
            "This is among one of the best classes I've taken at Michigan. You will learn so much about yourself and everyone around you. Be prepared to work hard for John, but he will work hard for you. IF you get a chance to take this class, do yourself a favor and TAKE IT! It will change your life perspective.", 
            "The best professor I have had at the University. He loves teaching and he loves his students. The English taught by John will be carried with me for the rest of my life. He also has many lessons about life. Do not expect to take this class hoping for a high grade. But do expect to learn a lot. You will not regret taking this class.", 
            "Took this class 20 years ago and still stay in touch with Rubadeau. He's the best.", 
            "John is quite possibly the best thing since sliced bread and the cotton gin. He may be even better than double sliced and regular gin. His beard is substantial, and guaranteed to either impress or frighten or both. It changes colors from time to time. No one knows why. Taking one of his classes will be your best decision. I guarantee!", 
            "I learned more practical skills in this class than in all my other classes combined. John's online course description is extremely candid. The course is not conceptually difficult, but you must be prepared to work. If you put the time in, you will not regret doing so."

            "Anne is a great professor! Her lectures are in depth, but she presents the material in an engaging way. She's pretty upfront with what she expects from you and is accessible during office hours and by email. It's important to keep up with readings and participate in class. I really enjoyed 306 and am thinking about taking 307 in the future!", 
            "Professor Manuel was a great prof. The class did have a lot of reading but you can't really expect anything else with political theory. Class was interesting and went by quickly (group work takes up 20 min). Pop quizzes are the only deterrent. Take this class!", 
            "This was a meh class- loved Justin though, the GSI. There are seven pop quizzes throughout the semester so you need to do the reading and attend class and be very prepared. Tests aren't easy but they are not hard either.", 
            "Anne is very knowledgeable about the class, however, her lectures tend to be scattered and don't follow too well with the readings. You must be well prepared for each class because pop quizzes occur.", 
            "Anne is an enthusiastic instructor who is passionate in teaching. She tries to have as much discussion as possible by asking students what do they think about the materials. Go to her office hours and raise your hands, you will do well on participation. Grading is really slow though.", 
            "Senior seminar was awesome! Easy grading, great discussions and valuable readings!", 
            "Prof. Manuel is very informative and really knows political theory. You can tell she loves teaching. She does give pop quizzes, usually 7 but you only need to pass 4. If you're not into reading, this class isn't for you. Besides participation/quizzes, it's just two exams and two short papers - only gripe is she takes a very long time to grade them.", 
            "Anne's energy makes her lectures fly by, at least when compared to most other profs. Exams are a bit odd: quote sheets are apparently optional, but it seems like you lose points for not including any quotes (not many, but still.) Definitely a lot of reading, but most of it's enjoyable, especially if you have an interest in political theory.", 
            "This class was super interesting. It covers a broad range of topics on a period in history that other professors tend to gloss over. There are seven pop reading quizzes per semester, you have to pass 4, they aren't hard at all. If you go talk to her she will be SO helpful! Highly recommend her/the class.", 
            "Anne is a great professor. I've taken two classes with her- 307 and now 495- and she's proven her immense knowledge and passion about the subject matter in both. She is really, really intelligent and super helpful- always there to give you help need be or meet about papers. She also cares about her students and their grasp on the material.", 
            "Subject and class was interesting, but she was ok. She took forever to give grades back and gives pop quizzes so you need to do the readings. It was too big of a class to do a lot of group work but she insisted on doing it anyway.", 
            "Didn't want to enroll in her class after all the comments, but I am so glad that I took it! Great professor, clear and fair grading system, very helpful at office hours, and the GSI is also great. There are a lot of readings but if you do them, you're gold for the exams and pop quizzes", 
            "Anne rambled on in lectures -often riddled not only with what many of us felt to be conceptual errors but also errors of fact 1xlecture or more. Shrilly voice, unclear expectations as to how she graded 50 people cramped in a MH classroom on their \"participation,\" and unwilling to hear discussion about essays after she hands down grades", 
            "I was extremely nervous to take her class because of the RMP reviews, but at the end of the semester, all I can say are great things. She gives very in-depth lectures, expects you to read everything, and is a fun professor. There are pop quizzes for reading, but if you do them you'll be fine. Don't put too much stock in bad reviews for this class!", 
            "Manuel is the worst Polisci professor I've had at Michigan. She took a month and a half to return a paper, and is all over the place in lecture. Her pop quizzes aren't bad, but her teaching is. The GSI was terrible as well, and they both expected you to agree with their opinion, or you were wrong. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES.", 
            "There are 6 quizzes throughout the semester and in order to pass you must pass 4. Therefore the lectures are basically mandatory. She squeezes in 2 hours of information in an hour and 20 minutes and although she is very helpful and intelligent, she talks at a million miles an hour. Be prepared to read between 60-100 pages a week.", 
            "This class was quite enjoyable. The amount of reading was very reasonable. Professor Manuel made it interesting despite the long and boring lectures that she had no choice but to give. She can seem a bit rigid at first but she is actually quite the opposite. A genuinely nice person who cares for her student. I would take another class with her.", 
            "Very knowledgable, pretty quirky, but you definitely have to take the responsibility to go up and engage her. Her teaching styler is not very hands-on unless you need it. Go to office hours and ask questions in class, she loves it. For a political theory class like the one I took, she made the material really accessible and fun to deal with.", 
            "About 50 pages of reading per night, with 6 pop quizzes on the reading that you can't pass the class without passing. Also very disorganized lectures."

He is very accessible outside of class and even encourages students to text him with any questions. Make sure you go to his office hours!! He'll work with you until you have the right answers on assignments",

He even gave out his work phone number for students to access him. I believe he is more helpful in office hours than in class. Chad is the man!!!", 
            "Going to lecture and discussion is pretty much useless. His lectures are very boring and he never gets through the whole lecture. But with that said, he's not as bad as everyone makes him out to be, most people hate him because they don't put any effort in. The material is pretty easy so if you actually take the time to learn it, you'll do fine.",

            "For the first two exams, it is fine if you read the textbook and see his slides. But for the final exam, go to his office hour and ask about the questions in sample exam that you don't know how to solve! But beware that his lectures are extremely boring and hard to concentrate. You have to learn by yourself, but he is willing to help in office hour",

I enjoy econ and think I'm not bad at it but Chad's tests proved otherwise. There are teachers at Umich that will be significantly better for getting a better grade and increasing your understanding.",

Go by his office hours at least a couple times, otherwise going you'll be floating by without actually understanding any of the material.P.S. Discussion sections don't matter aside from Part B of exams.",

Be sure to read and do the homework for understanding. His class is way harder than the other 101's at UM. However, he really does care and puts so much effort into helping you if you just ask.",

The absolute worst lecturer I have ever had. Redundant, slow paced, and focused on simple topics in class, leaving us confused about actual exam content.",

While hes easy to understand when I try listening, it does take effort to focus for the entire lecture because he is a bit on the dry side. However, he definitely is an intelligent guy and you can tell he tries to make things as clear as possible", 
            "His lectures are terribly dry and boring. I didn't go to lecture once. Just read the slides before the exams, take practice exams, do homework and you will be fine. Do not go to lecture or you will fall asleep. He spends like 30 minutes on one slide where I can knock out a slide at home for like 5 minutes. Class is fair, just bad professor.",

Attending class, doing the problem sets, and idk actually trying would probably change a majority of reviews here. If you do work and try, it is not bad. No one ever does tho."

Make sure you take one of his courses of you are an engineering student here.",

Best freshman and sophomore aerospace courses in the nation 100 and 205 are. My boy Washabaugh is simply the best professor. The lectures are a little dry but the labs and the courses overall are the best intro to Aero in the world",

Although his lectures are not required in the strictest sense, I found that Pete's anecdotes, witticisms, and advice enriched my life both professionally and personally.

Can't wait to take Aero205 with him.",

He's an extremely fair grader, and this class is basically a free A. The lab offers a lot of practical knowledge about CAD and CFD packages. Enjoy this class while it lasts, because 305405 are so much worse.",

Building a hovercraft seems like a daunting task but Washabaugh made it semi-easy. One downside is that the class can be a a little too much busy work but hey exams that are almost so easy that they are nonexistent. Do HW get A.",

He is very understanding, and seems to want everyone to do well. The class I took (Music in the Ancient World) was very rewarding and well put together.", 
            "Fun and kind teacher. Class wasn't too hard, but expect to do a little bit of reading.", 
            "Professor Verhoogt is a blast! He really knows his stuff, is EXTREMELY excited about teaching it, and can make any topic fun and interesting. He is Dutch and has a moderate accent, but really only makes him seem more quirky (not too hard to understand).", 
            "Excellent professor who really cares about students. Though there's a lot of reading assigned, you don't really need to read everything, just attend lectures and discussion, fill out study guide in advance, study it night before the test.", 
            "Verhoogt is an awesome professor. Very enthusiastic, humorous, and engaging in lecture. You can skip and still get an A, but you should go to class anyways because he's great. Exams are easy as long as you know the study guide.", 
            "I could grab a beer with this guy. Very funny and cares about what he is teaching. Have yet to have an exam but everybody has said they're easy if you pay attention and study. Every teacher should be like this. Go Arthur", 
            "Arthur is a wonderful professor and a super great person. I took \"litigation in Athens\" with no interest in the subject matter whatsoever, and it became one of my favorite classes because of him. Take his classes, easy A and you learn a lot! (the accent is a bonus)", 
            "I've had Arthur twice for Greek, for 101 and now for 401, and he is both a phenomenal teacher, and a great individual. He is super invested in your studies, your character, and your interaction with the text. He is funny, relaxed, and very understanding. I highly highly recommend ANY class he teaches.", 
            "Arthur is an awesome lecturer. The class isn't hard, just do the readings. It's definitely one of the more interesting humanities classes you can take if you just need the credit. You don't need to go to lectures, but I would just to hear Arthur, he's that funny.", 
            "Super easy class, the exams are cake. Read the book, skip lectures, and you'll get a guaranteed A. Class subject is interesting and this class doesn't require much busy work. I'd recommend it to everyone, regardless of their major.", 
            "Never once went to lecture and got an easy A. GSI based. Go to discussion, participate, and do homework/papers/readings for it. Exams are ridiculously easy, all information needed to know is clearly given to you and if you fail you did not study. I saw him on the exam he seems nice, but I can't say. Andrew Stem was my GSI and was the best GSI ever.", 
            "He was very enthusiastic about Roman Sports. The midterm and final were easy if you go to the review lecture right before the test. Attendance to lecture isn't necessary, but makes the class definitely easier since there are a LOT of terms. Gives essay Qs before the test.", 
            "Prof. Verhoogt (haha) was a fellow student of mine in Leiden, The Netherlands. He is a few years younger than I am and I knew that, as a student, he was already engageing in Papyrology. I'm delighted to hear about the good comments and ratings he is getting as a professor. You go, Arthur! Ms. drs Jacqueline E.M. Kuijpers, The Hague, NL", 
            "VERY COOL. He is very engaging in lecture and you can tell he really knows his stuff. He loves to crack jokes, and with his accent you can't help but laugh! The readings can be lengthy, but he logically breaks it down in lecture, so exams and assignments become easier. I would recommend taking one of his classes!", 
            "BEST PROFESSOR IVE EVER HAD! single handly makes any class enjoyable. incredibly easy grader and will proof read your rough drafts. he is very funny (accent only makes it more enjoyable) and is incredibly passionate about his teaching. probably the smartest man ive ever met, TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!", 
            "Professor Verhoogt is amazing. Very helpful, very entertaining, very knowledgeable.", 
            "I only took this class because he had high ratings on this site... and it was totally worth it! He knows the material like the back of his hand & is very passionate about what he teaches. I had no prior interest in Ancient Egypt, but I left the class totally inspired. Willing to proof-read essays before they're due, very personable, BEST PROF at UM", 
            "by far the most entertaining lecturer I've ever had. keeps the material interesting and breaks it down so it can be easily understood. he actually motivated me to do most of the reading and attend class. exams were pretty basic and straightforward. i loved the class so much i'm taking independent study with him"

However, Bergin is a solid professor who knows a lot about astronomy and is laid back and doesn't take himself too seriously. The tests are straightforward and don't count for much (11% x 3) anyways.", 
            "Bergin is a good professor and you can tell he loves what hes teaching. However, most kids are just taking this to get their natural science credit out of the way and he does not make the class easy at ALL. I would 100% NOT recommend to take this class again. I ended up doing OK but it was not worth it. Youre better off with PSYCH 112.", 
            "Professor Bergin knows a lot about the subject, and this knowledge reflected his teaching. However, I felt as if sometimes he wouldn't explain things well enough. Reading the textbook is a must if you want to get a good grade in the class.", 
            "Good guy, hard class. Its very frustrating, and its hard to know how to study for it. There are not very many resources. I would not recommend this if your'e looking for an easy A.", 
            "Really good Professor. A lot of kids find the class easy, but the exams are pretty hard. Lots of info is covered in the class and you have to go to class (iclicker attendance). Other than that, weekly projects are pretty easy. If your not good at memorizing a bunch of science terms and things about space, would not recommend.",

The other big component is exams (like 54%) and iclicker (around 6%). Prof. is very clear and his slide = exam answers. However slides are not posted, so be prepared to type a lot of notes. You can just read the textbook instead tho", 
            "Loved this class. Three exams, all pretty difficult, but the weekly homework is simple and worth about half of your grade. Prof Bergin really loves what he's teaching and keeps lectures interesting. Definite recommendation if you have any interest in astronomy.", 
            "I took this class as a filler for my schedule and an \"easy A\" Natural Science requirement. Bergin clearly loves what he is teaching and does a great job. But don't take this class if you don't have prior interest or have other harder classes to focus on. Midterm and final exam are ridiculously too hard. Weekly homework is easy. Iclicker is graded.", 
            "Great class. Prof. Bergin is a great instructor. The evolution is a stretch, but hey we can still gather data. Homework questions are straightforward and highlight the cool/amazing aspects of the universe. This class is a pure joy to learn.", 
            "Only 2 non-cumulative exams (mc) but homework every week (actually requires reading textbook and work). Not everything that's on the exam will be taught in full detail in class so the book is essential. It should be an easy class but it won't be if you're not interested in the subject, my advice would be don't take it. Iclicker Qs & attendence", 
            "This class is very interesting if you need to knock out some natural science credits but definitely not an automatic A. Exams are not too difficult but if you don't study, you'll be lost. Prof Bergin is really passionate about what he teaches which makes class more enjoyable. Weekly homeworks are a key part of the grade. Definitely recommended.",

He puts up powerpoints but never relies on them for his lecturing, because he knows all the material anyway. He is also very helpful in office hours and caring about your work", 
            "Took this class for HU distribution with limited interest before taking it. Wound up loving the course. Especially great for pre-health students as all of his examples and half the lectures are related to medicine or bioethics. Super nice guy also -- mix between \"the dude\" from big lebowski and a teddy bear. Very easy also, with limited work.", 
            "His work on the chalk board is hard to follow as he doesn't clean it properly so you can only read it whilst he's saying it out loud, otherwise, you have to decipher layers of writing. He's also always late even for Michigan time, exams included. I would avoid taking a class with him if possible.", 
            "Not the most exciting class, and I had no interest in it so it was a bit of a struggle at times. But it was alright and a decent intro to logic.", 
            "This class was fairly easy if you put in the time and work. MacPherson does a good job of explaining concepts, however, it may not be his fault but this was the most boring, dull class i have ever taken. VERY BORING!! Do not take this class if you are looking for an enjoyable time.",

If you are able to think in a logical manner (which I hope all students have the ability), the class should be enjoyable and stimulating. Sometimes lectures can be a bit confusing, but take some time on your own to study the material and you should be fine.",

That is absurd. He decides after your first assignment.",

The class wasn't too difficult but he will make you work for the A. His feedback is always thorough and spot-on. Substantial amount of reading every week but nothing far from manageable.",

Focusing during lecture is crucial because he speaks his notes as opposed to putting them on the board. Lots of reading as well, but the big picture view Squatriti gives on the period is amazing.",

He encouraged student participation and most of the class time was spent discussion that week's readings. He kind of a tough grader on papers but if you use the sources you'll do fine.",

He is an incredible resource of information about this time in history and always is willing to answer questions. You will take a lot of notes in his class because you will want to remember everything he says. Amazing man",

His slideshow presentations are not to be missed, especially the Apocalypse presentation. I nearly died laughing! Fun and witty, he possesses a wealth of knowledge. I HIGHLY recommend him. He's a stellar instructor!",

His style of allowing the student to choose which two essays they wanted to write gives a degree of freedom most professors do not allow. I thoroughly enjoyed both Prof. Squatriti and the class and would take him again in a heartbeat.",

            "A lot of the harsher ratings are misleading. The problem is that Thomas's classes focus on linguistics but are marketed as English classes, which they aren't. He can be repetitive and dry at times, but he's not the terrible prof these make him out to be", 
            "He's a really nice guy. He takes time to meet with you whenever you can. He's very unclear though. A lot of the papers didn't even have an official topic and it's hard to understand why he gives you the grade he does on papers.", 
            "Tom is a saint. This is my second class with him, and he's proven to be a genuinely nice guy. Old English is challenging, but he makes it interesting and doable.", 
            "I enjoyed taking this linguistics class with Thomas. He's funny, he's bright, and our class was a little more structured than these comments might lead you to believe. Just a little though. 3 essays, 1 weekly homework, and 1 weekly journal assignment. You'll write about 4-6 pages a week (easy stuff), and 4-6 pages per essay.", 
            "Thomas is really a sweet man. He does ramble a lot but if you are interested in the topic, his rambling are about linguistics. He really knows his stuff and wants everyone to do well. He is very helpful in office hours and so personable. This course was a bit work heavy, but it helped to understand and I actually DID the readings. Would recommend!", 
            "Nice guy. Not the best professor. Unclear expectations. The homework isn't that bad. Again, his instructions aren't clear and he doesn't clarify things well when you ask questions. We watched a lot of superfluous movies in his class. Cracks a lot of jokes (or tries to, anyway). In my opinion, an easy A if you're okay with no class structure.", 
            "One of the best professors I ever had. One of the most rewarding classes.", 
            "I've taken 3 classes with Toon--he's great! He's very enthusiastic about language, which will sometimes result in tangential class discussion, but all interesting for the most part. You have freedom to pursue your own interests for assignments. Lots of busy work, but it's easy and relevant to what he tests and quizzes on. Highly recommended!", 
            "Really good professor for Old English-teaches you how to read, translate, and understand. Not only do I have a better understanding of the roots of English, but I better understand basic phonology and morphology as well. Helpful during office hours, really friendly. Only thing to watch out for are the quizzes.", 
            "Tommy Toon cares about his students, but he is just an awful professor. His handwriting is terrible and his ability to explain the information is even worse. Don't take his class unless you have to.", 
            "The man will humiliate you in class. No one dares asks questions. Likes to punish his students and decides early on who the \"good\" students are. Does not teach the material in such a way as to facilitate your learning it--and it is intentional. RUN FOR YOUR LIFE.", 
            "Toon's a bit difficult to understand. He's really a nice guy, and seems to want everyone to do well, but he's not the greatest instructor. He knows his stuff, but when he passes it along it tends to morph into something more complicated than it really needs to be. But, as long as you come to class every day and try hard on all the hw, you'll be ok.", 
            "Be careful with this class. It's more about linguistics than anything else, so VERY DRY. Nor is this an easy class. There is no textbook except for Baugh, so you'll learn everything straight from Toon. He's a very nice guy, but an AWEFUL teacher. Confusing and talks too fast for notetaking. No visuals or clear examples. & HW is VERY timeconsuming.", 
            "This is a small class, so Toon is very personable. I had this class at 8:30 in the morning, which was not fun, but I somehow made it through. Toon only allows one absence before you lose 5 points so beware if it's early. I actually learned a lot about OE but only how to read, not speak. I got a fairly easy A. (take home midterm and final)", 
            "Loony Toony lives up to his name. He's super quirky and gets progressively easier as the class goes on. I'm also a linguistics major (the class is cross-listed), so I found the material interesting. His quizzes, tests, and hw is purely busy work. Nice easy A!", 
            "this class goes from hard to very easy. toon loves to ramble The first two weeks of the classes will be the hardest for you...then it's repititive and a breeze. Text= expensive and only helps you for the first part of class. The test is essentially a long quiz. Quizzes are given at least once a week HW= OED+Textbook BS Presentation- eh..not long", 
            "NO. Just NO. Do not take this class with Toon. It's a waste of time and you learn nothing. You spend money on the book, but then he contradicts everything in it and nothing from the book is ever on his exams. Lectures are incomprehensible. Take another class instead!!", 
            "I'm having an awful time in this class... Everything that I'm learning is coming from my GSI, and I remain eternally confused during his lectures. Maybe he's better in his other lectures, but avoid English 308!", 
            "Worst class ever!", 
            "Trust me, you don't want to take this class. It has no structure, assignments take so long and are useless and grades are not determined fairly. Not to mention lectures are extremely boring and Toon is not very good at explaining things. This class is like taking a foreign language. Stay clear!"

            "Juan Cole, is a great professor and lecture; he's renowned by his work in the feild of Near Eastern Studies and he'll sure make you aware of it. Additionally, professor, Cole makes teh class engaging and intriguing, Indefinitely recommend taking the course if you have an interest in contemporary Middle Eastern politics; however, a lot of reading", 
            "Juan Cole knows a ton about the Middle East and his exams were pretty easy, but I thought his lectures were really boring and dry. Class isn't mandatory and you can do well just by doing the reading and going to discussion", 
            "Juan knows a ton on his field, probably more than anybody else around. However, he sometimes can go on tangents in lecture and is rushed to finish the material at the end of the class. Take a class with Juan Cole because he is a legend at Michigan.", 
            "Dr. Cole is an expert on the Middle East, and I would highly recommend taking the class. While it's certainly difficult, the amount you can learn from attending his lectures and doing the readings is incredible. Admittedly, he assigns way more reading than anyone can actually do, and study guides make the exams much easier to prepare for.", 
            "If you're willing to put in the work, this class is great. Cole is brilliant and truly knows his stuff on the Middle East. There is A LOT of reading, but if you actually want to know about the topic, its worth doing. You can get away with not attending lecture but only if you do the reading. Exams weren't too difficult if you paid attention.", 
            "Switch out. Cole seemed cool, then i realized how bad of a lecturer he is. No hype in 241.", 
            "I wish someone had warned me about this terrible professor before I took his class. Anyone who is thinking of signing up for his class- don't! Worst prof. I've ever had, bar none.", 
            "Professor Cole was a pleasure to have as my professor. Extremely knowledgeable in the field of US-Middle East relations. At times he could be dry but he still gets all points across. Unrealistic amount of readings assigned so be prepared. Absolutely must go to class. The format of the exams change by year and can be slightly challenging.", 
            "The man is an expert in what he teaches. You will learn more in this class than all your others combined if you do the readings and attend lecture, unfortunately you need not learn at all for a good grade in the class. 2 finals and section makes up the entire grade and study guides are presented in advance. Would be a great class with more structue", 
            "Juan Cole is probably one of the most amazing instructors I've ever had! Take his class! It's hard work but definitely worth it!", 
            "Experienced not just in academia but also practical application of history and Arabic in the 'real world.' Opinion is evident in lectures, he is up front about his slant on history, honest and transparent. Very interesting reading materials. Grading expectations were eh. but that was the fault of the GSIs", 
            "He's a legend and an inspiration. I highly recommend his class.", 
            "Took this class last year, and seeing it on the course guide now reminded me of how much I truly got out of it. So I still don't agree with everything he taught, but I think it was good for me to really question certain beliefs Ive always held\u2014 and I guess that's what education is about, right? Replacing our beliefs with..you know, facts. good prof", 
            "Cole is an expert in every sense of the word. He has field experience in most of the countries he lectures on, and provides lots of interesting asides on the course content. Readings are mandatory, but interesting. Test questions are given ahead of time, and you pick which ones you want to answer. Overall highly recommend Professor Cole!", 
            "Cole is a complete genius. He is very liberal, but he knows his stuff and is very insightful. The lectures are interesting and worthwhile. There is a ton of reading , which is unrealistic to do, but if you go to lecture and study a lot you'll be fine.", 
            "Dr. Cole IS very knowledgeable about the ME. But he's hopelessly myopic on some of his analyses, many of which he disingenuously presents as objective fact. Sometimes he's insightful, but this is irrevocably tainted by his borderline paranoid conspiracy theories (see his blog). Be careful! Know what to take seriously, and what to throw out as crap.", 
            "Prof Cole is so knowledgeable about the ME so any class with him is worthwhile. However, the title of this course represents false advertising as there was almost NO discussion of the Arab Spring. Very disappointing. Also, Prof. Cole seemed uninterested in the class/preoccupied with outside commitments, canceling more than 25% of class sessions.", 
            "I have never had a better professor. Juan Cole is one of the most knowledgeable people on the Middle East, and is an incredibly interesting lecturer. He is somewhat biased and a little bit pompous but the man knows his stuff. Kind of the epitome of earning his Michigan arrogance.", 
            "Juan Cole is extremely knowledgeable about modern Middle Eastern history. He is an engaging lecturer and very open to questions and debate. He does a good job of presenting both sides of an issue."

The workload is very manageable and the books that he has you read are excellent. He is a bit tough on essays, but only to help you improve as a writer. Your grade will be exactly what you deserve.", 
            "Don't take this class unless you LOVE nature. Assigns readings, but they're not helpful. Length of papers are flexible, but they have to total up to a certain amount. Dislike the workshop style - a lot of times it's him talking. Pushes you in delivering work and is very specific about he wants out of an essay... Save your absences for workshop", 
            "I took his Midwestern lit class as a sophomore because I saw one of my favorite books on the reading list. Two years later, I still find myself learning from it, as a friend, writer, and human being. Wow, that sounds so sappy. But it's true.", 
            "As a senior, I definitely appreciated this class, which is the only one I went to regularly this semester. Aric is brilliant and hilarious and doesn't take BS from anyone. He made us work hard, but it pays off. I've never had a class where students get so much attention, he really cares what you have to say and makes you want to participate.", 
            "Aric says he wants you to learn, but he spends most class periods doing most of the talking during \"discussion.\" He's very anal, and you really have to tell him what he wants to hear in order to get a good grade. I would definitely not recommend him.", 
            "Aric has a very different teaching style. I took his Midwestern lit class, based on discussions that sometimes went on far too long. He expects you to keep up with a very rigorous reading schedule and makes few allowances if you haven't kept up. Sometimes it's difficult to keep up with him, but the class is interesting. Tough grader, but good guy.", 
            "Aric has a very unconventional teaching style, which he is aware of. He doesn't really have an agenda and likes to ask open-ended questions and never arrive to a solid conclusion. His grading is VERY- he doesn't provide rubrics for assignments. Also says on 1st day thatmost people get a B in his class, crushing your hopes of getting anything higher", 
            "The best english class i have ever taken and it is all because of Aric. He is a wonderful teacher and his classes are discussion based which makes class really interesting and worthwhile. He is very friendly and helpful with assignments and gives criticism in a very good, productive way.", 
            "Aric's awesome, but not everyone's cup of tea. He can sometimes take us off tangent, and he always poses questions without giving us the answer, which is planned - he firmly believes that students should grow along with the professor. He won't hold your hand with an assignment, but if you have specific questions, he's really helpful. Love him.", 
            "Love him. Ran discussion really well. He pushes you in paper writing and is incredibly insightful and fun.", 
            "Aric is an absolutely wonderful teacher- his criticism is honest and delivered in a positive way. I had a wonderful experience in his class, it is sort of a lot of writing, but well worth it!",

But the textbook was actually pretty good, and the class is one of the easiest classes I've taken. Shouldn't be hard to sit through",

She made you buy the textbook which is edited by her for $80. Note you HAVE to buy a new one because of the tear out questions on the book. Buying a used book is NOT an option.",

It was mainly memorization of her slides. Greta is also very biased, bringing in guest professors that were very clear about their personal political views.", 
            "As a new International Studies major, I was excited for this class only to be let down. She seems nice but the class is so broad with such little detail that it becomes hard to stay invested. The text book is a rip-off, if you have friends in the class split an online textbook. It is only used for one online, open book test. Take it if you have to.", 
            "Take it if you need to; otherwise, it's not an enormously interesting class. She knows her field but the course is honestly just stringing things together and there generally isn't much depth across all topics. Lecture slides are a bit scant in terms of text/content so going to lecture can matter. Study guides cover everything you need to know.", 
            "The class was fairly easy. Probably put 10 hours of work into class the whole semester and did not go to any of the lectures. The one paper is graded extremely easily. If its an easy A you're looking for, take this class, If you're looking to learn, maybe look elsewhere.",

Very happy this class is over.",

She makes a big deal about how \"coding is for everyone\" blah blah but if you have questions, she often makes you feel inferior. Her emails and comments on Piazza are very rude. Its time for her to retire honestly. Don't go to Dorf for help with this class, the IA's are your best bet.", 
            "Dorf isn't the best lecturer but you don't have to worry about her tbh. The IAs and Office Hours are the lifeblood of this class. Go to office hours and start early! Can't stress this enough! You will do well if you do that. Overall, really great class. It's set up extremely well and the projects are fun! I recommend it to everyone!",

Make sure to not miss any lectures if you don't have to; do all of the CodeLab exercises/practice tests, and you'll be sure to do well in the class!",

            "Bruce Conforth is the most passionate, intelligent, and talented person and musician I have ever met. I wish I took more of his courses, as his History of American Blues Music enhanced my perspective on so many things. A true icon of the music world.", 
            "I am so lucky to have taken a class taught by this guy! Insanely passionate and funny, really knows his stuff, and I never wanted to miss a lecture.", 
            "Coolest dude ever, really knows what he's talking about and cares about students. Class was based on weekly reflection papers, 3 take-home online quizzes, midterm, final, and one project. Don't bother doing any readings - don't even buy the book. Go to his office hours with your midterm, he will give you points back.", 
            "If you show up to class every day and really pay attention to his lectures, Bruce will probably change your life - fair warning. I have never had another professor that has half the passion and zeal that he brings to every single lecture. He cares immensely about the topics that he teaches and he cares about his students even more. Don't miss out.", 
            "This was my favorite class of all time. Bruce teaches because he wants to inspire, and he wants students to reflect on what they are doing with themselves. I never missed a lecture because they were so interesting, and I would talk about what I'd be learning with my friends because I enjoyed it to that extent. Definitely take a class with Bruce", 
            "This guy was great! He was passionate each and every day he came to class and seemed as knowledge as anyone about the information he was teaching. The material reflected a great deal of personal depth and experience. He was rarely competitive. There are two exams with easy online homework in-between. On the whole, a worthwhile class.", 
            "The fact that Dr. Conforth is a great scholar in the subjects he teaches (I've taken AC208, AC219, and AC405 with him) the fact that he has personal experience in each topic makes him an invaluable resource as a teacher. I doubt that there are many other professors who have as much and as extensive real world experience in their topics as he does.", 
            "Bruce's seminar on American Folk music was an amazing experience. We discussed the incredible link between folk music and left wing politics (something I knew nothing about), the ways in which people band together as communities and create art to express themselves and build solidarity, and so so much more. Amazing class.", 
            "Legend", 
            "Easily one of the best professors at UM. Never known a single person to have a bad opinion of him. He is incredibly knowledgeable about the 60s and the hippy movement (as a result of him being very deeply ingrained in it). His stories make each class fun, and I am changing my plans for future classes to take more with him.", 
            "Hippies, Beatniks, and Punks was the best class I've taken at U of M so far. I actually WANTED to go to class, because Bruce is such an inspirational guy. His lectures are really interesting, I felt like I got to know all three of the subcultural groups, but my favorite parts of the class were Bruce's life stories. Definitely take this class.", 
            "After 4 years I finally got to take Bruce's subcultures course and wow was it worth the wait! I don't think there are any other professors like Bruce anywhere. He's caring, compassionate, unbelievably intelligent, witty, funny, hot as hell, and just is everything and more that you'd want in a professor. An amazingcourse, Bruce is incredible!", 
            "Bruce Conforth is honestly one of the best professors I have had. He makes everyone feel like they matter in his class. He tries to make his lectures not only about the information, but also about life in general. The quizzes and tests are kind of tough, but this class is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Take it.", 
            "This is the 3rd class I've taken with Professor Conforth and every one has been remarkable. He's a great teacher. Clear, concise, interesting, funny, and extremely knowledgeable. He's just an amazing prof. The best UM has to offer.", 
            "This class has been nothing short of astonishing. I never experienced anything like the remarkable way Dr. Conforth teaches and I don't think I ever will again. He's the smartest, most caring professor you could want. I've already learned more about the topic and life than I have in all my other classes combined and I'm a senior! Take his class", 
            "It is absolutely unbelievable the way that Bruce teaches a class. Not only is he an amazing scholar and knows so much about so many things, the life lessons he teaches you are remarkable. If you go to class (you'll want to) and you pay attention (it's hard not to) you'll leave his class an infinitely greater person.", 
            "I was expecting a bit more from Professor Conforth; with all the hype, i thought this would be the greatest class I ever took by a long shot. Not the case - while the course was interesting, it just didn't live up to the hype. Not hard to get a good grade if you study enough for the exams, and lecture was always fairly interesting to attend.", 
            "Bruce is a legend at UM and there many reasons why. He's compassionate, incredibly interesting, REALLY knows a LOT, worked at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and as a musician, he's a scholar, but most of all he REALLY cares if you learn the stuff in class and how you can apply it to your own life. He's hands-down the best prof at UM!", 
            "Dr. Conforth is an awesome professor. His lectures are very interesting and you can tell he genuinely enjoys the subject matter. The class is pretty easy to get a B- in, but beyond that you really need to work hard to get a better grade. I, unfortunately, realized I was not interested in folklore, but Dr. Conforth still made lectures interesting", 
            "He is easily the best professor on the plant. He truly cares about all of the students and wants everyone to learn. He is so passionate about what he does, and it really shows in his lectures, He is just a great person."

I wish I had more lectures with him than just once a week; he's an amazing lecturer! Always do the HWs, review the class notes, do the practice quizzes/exams, and you should be fine.", 
            "Great professor, interesting material, makes perfect sense in class, and when you do hw, it looks like peace of cake. BUT when you take the exam, it's a whole different story, it's BRUTAL!! it's like wheres this stuff coming form?!! so def requires that you need to put more effort in 271, than you actually think or whats assigned", 
            "Do you agree that Klemstine is awesome?", 
            "I had such low expectations for this class but I honestly didn't get bored in the lectures because Klemstine has such a wacky personality and really tries to keep the material engaging. That, in addition to his clear way of explaining things, made this one of my favorite lectures, which was definitely something that ended up surprising me.", 
            "Awesome prof. Very exciting in lecture and makes dry subject interesting. The class is among the best in terms of organization at Michigan and if you follow the book you should do fine (the exam questions are taken directly from there with just different numbers) great class the foundation of b-school.", 
            "ACC271 is not that hard -- I'm in LSA and took the class anyway, rarely went to class and still got an A. My friends in the B-school worked their asses off for a B/B+ . I have much less respect for the B-school after taking this class, LSA Math/Econ/Stats much more difficult", 
            "One of the best professors at u of m. He makes lectures interesting despite the not so interesting subject. If you know how to do all the practice problems in the book, you'll be fine.", 
            "Hardest class at Michigan, hands down! You're screwed if you miss one lecture. The test are unreal. 90 minutes for 30 questions = fast-paced! Whether you're a BBA or in LSA taking this class....good luck.", 
            "Klemstine is the man. In spite of a very dry subject matter, he somehow finds a way to make class interesting and entertaining.",

            "Dr. Scodel is a nice person, but is old and tends to ramble. If you have no interest in humanities and think classics are rather pointless, avoid \"Great Books\" like the plague. I don't mind reading but these texts seem so irrelevant. Your grade will depend on the GSI. Mine was rather unforgiving.", 
            "Hands down the worst professor I've had so far. Her lectures were sloppy to say the least; she rambled endlessly and her PowerPoints were barely coherent. The syllabus looked like it was thrown together the day before classes started as an afterthought. Her office hours were even less helpful than her lectures and grades wholly depend on your GSI.", 
            "Lectures are not good for writing papers; essentially, she just gives a rundown of what happened in the book. Also, if you want to do well, get a good GSI. Mine wasn't and barely gave out A's. Prompts are very vague. Take another honors class if you can.", 
            "Wouldn't have taken this class if it wasn't mandatory for Honors. Scodel's informative and interesting enough, but I stopped going about midway through semester because they aren't really necessary for the papers you need to write. Your grade depends a lot on your GSI - mine was terrible and gave far lower grades than any of the other GSIs.", 
            "Reading is 'required,' but that's up to one's ability when writing papers and how much one's graduate student asks questions. Lectures are ... interesting. Prof. Scodel talks about the books in a way that may not be very helpful for papers, but the lectures are still intriguing.", 
            "Since the class is based purely on papers, going to lecture was not very beneficial. However, if you are really interested in classic literature the lectures are thought provoking. She holds office hours, which is nice. Your grade and experience in the class is very dependent on your GSI, since thye grade all of your papers and participation.", 
            "The lecture isn't mandatory for the class, because in lecture she basically gives fun facts/her opinions about the books we read. Nothing in lecture have I ever used on one of my papers. A good GSI and attending discussion are all you need to get an A. If you like waking up at 9am and hearing opinions that don't affect you or your grade, feel free.", 
            "She knows what she is talking about, but her class is essentially live spark notes. If you read the books, there is no reason to come to lecture. I fall asleep everyday. GSI is essential for a good grade. Papers are graded harshly.", 
            "One of the worst professors I have had. I learned nothing.",

            "I really liked listening to her lecture, and it was always interesting. I didn't always like her choice in books/translations, but the class overall was ok. Not the best or worst class that I've taken here. The grading really depends on the GSI that you get.", 
            "Ruth was not a very good lecturer. She spent 2 hours a week throwing her opinions at you in a voice that is painful to the ears. She clearly thinks she is the most brilliant person ever, but my GSI was far more helpful.", 
            "Scodel obviously had a grasp of the material, but never talked about it during lecture. Often went on tangents. We wrote 6 papers whereas the noners only had to write 3. Grades depended on GSI, but most people ended up with decent grades.",

            "This class was terrible. Extremely poorly administered. Professor Scodel's lectures were pointless and didn't contribute to anything at all. Grades are totally up to the GSI, which were extremely subjective. I didn't learn anything.", 
            "Lecture sucks. Way too trivial, too many scholarly anecdotes, too little discussion of overriding themes, motifs, symbolism etc. Simply, she didn't help us become better readers. She also forced us to go to this horrible symposium, just because having a lot of people there would make some donor to the classics department happy. Try classic civ", 
            "Some of the lectures are messy and have no point, grading is too harsh for an honors class, has never taught in such a large class so lacks the ability to use any technology, but the class is a good way to meet a lot of nice and smart people.", 
            "This course is not THAT bad. It can get a bit annoying sometimes with the amount of reading required but some of it can be interesting. She's pretty quirky in lecture. Don't feel as though you HAVE to take Great Books though. People might try to convince you otherwise but I hear Classic Civ is just as good."

The grade was almost solely based on essay grades, but my writing improved dramatically. He was super understanding of how busy students are and was pretty flexible. If you work hard, it will pay off. Fritz is the best!",

He cares for us and is 100% understanding, and loves to impart advice to students in talks. I took a intro year English 124 with him, and was more than happy with it, definitely my favorite class.",

He is an engaging speaker, honestly one of the most entertaining professors I have had, and provides extremely helpful feedback on papers. His peer review sessions were very helpful.",

He makes the material engaging and interesting. It helps to have some knowledge of famous writing but it isn't necessary. There's a lot of reading and less writing, which was a little disappointing.",

Cons: There are A LOT of readings (coursepack) and you have to do outlines. However, they are graded on participation. Class can get boring... TIP: Go in for office hours! You'll get an A in the class.",

Class is centered around readings and discussion, but each reading is different and meaningful towards the class. Discussion is super interesting and his story-telling/narrative talents are amazing. Would definitely take this class again if I could!",

Take your papers to his office hours... he seems to have a very specific idea for writing. His advice isn't bad, but to get an A, you may need to write what Fritz wants, not what you want.",

            "Prof. Tarle is fantastic! His class is extremely interesting and is a comprehensive mix of both energy physics and policy. You can't be afraid of a little math but he was very very helpful both one-on-one and on an in-class basis. Additionally, his grading policy is extremely forgiving and he genuinely wants everyone to do well.", 
            "Very willing to put in extra time to help students. This is a hard class, but if you talk to him about what you don't understand he will make sure you figure it out.", 
            "Tarle is ok. The class itself is very challenging, and that is the biggest hurdle. His problem is that he spends WAY too much time on things that don't matter, and rushes through things that do.", 
            "Tarle is adorable (in a grandpa sort of way), but he spends too much time on the wrong things. He is very helpful in office hours, but isn't an amazing lecturer. This class is tough but doable... the best part of the class is when he tells stories (like how DNA structure was discovered or about his childhood), but they're rare so enjoy them!", 
            "Professor Tarle can seem unorganized or unclear during lecture, but if you pay attention, you'll do fine. He tells you what you need to know for exams, and the online resources are a big help. The thing that sets Tarle apart is his how much he cares. He takes time and tries to make sure the class is following him. If you ask for help, you'll get it", 
            "Physics is generally a hard class, but Tarle explains it well enough. Lecture slides are sometimes pointless but another prof made them for our section. Discussions are useful because they make up the exams, but office hours are really helpful. Tarle will go out of your way to make sure you understand despite the complicated concepts.", 
            "he is santa", 
            "I had an honors lab class with Greg... and he was awesome! He was very helpful and friendly. He brought in home baked pastries every class because he felt bad that we were in the class during dinner time. You can just tell that he really enjoys what he is teaching.", 
            "He obviously loves physics and I think he is genuinely a nice guy and wants his students to understand the class...but...his exams are ridiculously hard (averages for sp09 were 10/20 and 11/20 for his midterms). Unless you love and really \"get\" physics I'd take it with someone else who does a better job \"dumbing\" things down...", 
            "I had a lab class with him, and thought he was a really good teacher - he explained concepts clearly, would always answer questions patiently (even when the student was completely lost), and was pretty enthusiastic. Not sure why the other raters didn't like him - perhaps because I had a higher level honors class, with higher quality students.", 
            "Horrible. Test are hard even though I did all the homework.", 
            "Not bad, and he's a very nice guy, always eager to help and talk to you after class. But the lectures can get dull, and the quizzes often don't reflect the concepts being emphasized in said lectures. His teaching can be quite good, but not consistently so.", 
            "i hated him as a teacher, his tests and quizes were ridiculously hard and did not reflect on the matieral learned in class.", 
            "He really liked physics and was always pleasant but... his lectures were not useful. He'd spent so much time on one stupid thing and then cram all of the important stuff into the last 5 minutes of class.", 
            "No Comments", 
            "Gregory Tarle is a great professor. He is very clear, and friendly. He actually gave us an extra 30min per exam (2 hrs instead of 1:30), which was a huge help. He made physics 126 bearable."

            "Sarter is clearly knowledgeable in neuroscience, however he has a tendency to forget that his students are not yet and brush over complicated material. Your grade is based on three 30 question exams that are very science-based and difficult. If you're looking to take an easy 200 level psych don't take this course.", 
            "I'm an econ major taking this class to learn (pass/fail though). This class is by no means an easy class. I had a hard time paying attention because lectures were heavy, but it's essential to listen! The first exam is the hardest but the next two were memorization based. Funny guy, but not your typical exam questions. Enjoyable class and material!", 
            "Sarter is a great teacher who often makes jokes and makes biopsych interesting. Your whole grade is based off of 3 exams, but honestly if you go over every single slide from lecture before the test and write the concepts down, you'll do fine. Textbook isn't necessary but very helpful if you miss lecture.", 
            "There is little margin for error in the class as each exam is only 30 questions. Understanding slides is essential, but the textbook often explains basic concepts and anatomy better than lecture. Lecture is primarily useful for sorting out strengths and weaknesses of various biopsychological approaches.", 
            "I agree with the notecards trick -- it will save your life in this class. I really enjoyed the class, but mostly because of the topic, not the professor. This is not a \"psych\" class; I believe that the people who didn't like the class were definitely expecting something easy. It is by no means an easy A, but super interesting material!!", 
            "Notecards, notecards, notecards. Either write out the concepts on one side and the definitions/explanations on the other side, or use Quizlet. Use spaced repetition to make sure all the information sticks in your hea permanently throughout the unit. I put few hours each week for reading + notecards and I've been getting As on all the exams!! :D", 
            "Class is ultimately based on how well you do on your three exams, which are only 30 questions, so if you get 5 wrong you are already in trouble. He writes the test to trick you with doing choices like A, A and B, A B and C, which gets annoying. He's a nice guy but can be confusing at times. It's not as easy as other 200-level psychs.", 
            "Although Professor Sarter is a nice and fun professor, his exams were tough and his lectures were boring. Your grade is ultimately determined by how well you do on 3 exams (30 multiple choice each), which are tricky and poorly written. If you could wait to take the course with another professor, I would recommend that.", 
            "Sarter can be sarcastic and funny and makes an hour and a half behavioral neuroscience class interesting. I will say though, that it was hard sometimes to understand what he was saying due to his accent and phrasing so sometimes I had to refer back to the book for clarification, but the material and tests itself is very straightforward", 
            "He's not as bad as most students think he is. He's just very knowledgeable in biopsych. People often underestimate psych classes, but don't underestimate this one. That's how you'll pass. You don't need the book at all. EVERYTHING is on his slides. Understand the slides; don't breeze through them; make a study guide! 3 exams, 30 questions each.", 
            "Dr. Sarter is sarcastic, organized, and knowledgable -- and I love it. His lectures are jam-packed with recent studies and information, and he very well knows what he is talking about. Thoroughly understand each lecture slide and you will be fine! This was my favorite class at Michigan so far!", 
            "Dr. Sarter takes extra time on concepts previous classes had trouble with & makes sure that everyone in lecture understands the concept before moving on. Test questions are tricky if you don't understand the material. If you understand the material the answer will be obvious. High % of questions with \"all of the above\" as the correct answer.", 
            "I'm purely rating Dr. Sarter as a warning to students about to take biopsych with him. This will be the most objective review you will see. Knowing and memorizing the material is not enough for this class, and i don't mean you have to apply concepts and bullsht like that. His tests have such poor wording and ambiguity - avoid if you care about A's", 
            "GO TO LECTURE IF YOU WANT TO PASS. Lots of tough concepts are covered in class, and you MUST study after each lecture if you want to pass.", 
            "A lot of people here are talking about how Sarter doesn't like questions -- I disagree. He sometimes has a teeny bit of a superiorsupercilious attitude when answering questions, but I don't think he's aware of it -- just a personality quirk I think. He is often very encouraging to students and asks for questions all the time. He's a great prof.", 
            "His lectures are funny but he can really go off on tangents sometimes. He seems willing to help and he definitely wants us to do well, but it does seem like he gets annoyed sometimes when people ask questions. The exams aren't too bad (a bit nitpicky sometimes) but the fact there are only 30 MC questions means you have almost no room for error.", 
            "Wow! This class was by far my favorite class at Michigan. Dr. Sarter is really engaging! His introduction to biological psychology was inspiring and reaffirmed my interest in neuroscience.", 
            "So the thing about Sarter is that even though you can tell he's a brilliant guy, he gives off this really superior air to his students. While he constantly begs us to ask questions, if we ask something already hinted at or spoken about in lecture before, he will give you the \"disappointed dad\" sort of vibe. Lectures are informative but very dry", 
            "There are many reviews about his exams and his lecture. If you attend lecture& ACTIVELY pay attention & take notes, you will understand everything. Tests are bit difficult, but they test your conceptual knowledge (no memorizing and spit everything back out). If you fully understand concepts, no reason you cannot pull an A.", 
            "Dr. Sarter changed my undergraduate career. Taking this class as freshman, I was unaware of the science major I had desired, and he made this simple for me. Dr. Sarter is incredibly established in the field, and respected by many worldwide, however, it seems as if the respect from his students is of importance to him. He is helpful and inspiring."

He's so kind and always willing to help out. And despite his intelligence, he's able to understand and answer students' questions without being rude or condescending. He's great.", 
            "RAILTON! RAILTON! RAILTON! My section would frequently chant this after lecture while waiting for him to come to section. Absolutely brilliant. If you've never taken an ethics class before he starts off a little too heavy with overwhelming vocabulary, but after a few classes I settled in just fine. The sweetest old man you'll ever meet.", 
            "Railton is, perhaps, my favorite professor. He's kind, understanding, and exceedingly available to help out. Don't let his charming demeanor fool you, however, his class is a lot of work, but well worth the effort. You'll likely come away a person changed for the better, with a deeper understanding of yourself and your place in the world.", 
            "PR is the man. He is a leading scholar and a wonderful lecturer. He is also oddly hilarious. He is amazingly helpful both academically and personally. He directed me to some readings to help me out of a slump and always had his door open when I needed someone to talk to. He's so smart his explanations can often seem a bit cryptic though.",

            "This is truly a great class. Professor Railton is an incredibly nice man, and always there for help. I emailed him once with a question about a paper and he responded with loads of information and advice. Lectures can drag on, but the slides are very clear and helpful. If you are interested in Ethics or philosophy, this is a good class to take.", 
            "Amazing ethics teacher. Clearly extremely knowledgeable about the subject and presents lectures in an entertaining way. Lots of good opportunities for students to interact and get to know him. Leaves good feedback on papers. Clearly interested in student success. Clear expectations. Reasonable exams and paper topics. Overall excellent prof.",

            "Professor Railton is very knowledgeable and a great professor. He has a tendency of throwing some comedy into his lectures which is always a plus. Some concepts are challenging but if you go discussion it helps clear things up. I recommend his discussion in particular. It is impossible to write everything down in class so a laptop is recommended.", 
            "Professor Railton is a great lecturer. He is extremely intelligent and also quite funny. Lectures are somewhat optional, but he makes somewhat dull topics quite interesting. If you can get him as a discussion leader, I would highly recommend it!",

Although at times the material was challenging, Professor Railton made me want to thoroughly understand every subject. The class is good; make sure you attend lecture, however. Professor Railton was awesome, and so was my GSI.", 
            "I have to say professor Railton is an awesome professor. It is obvious he really enjoys his job and he is very knowledgeable in his field. His lectures are great, I have not touched my textbook at all and am doing fine in the class (received an A on my midterm). You get study guides and review sessions. Great class", 
            "Although the lectures seem indefinite, he presents the material well and relates it with relevant examples. The section readings had the potential to be very interesting, but too much time was put into understanding the lecture. Take it", 
            "This class was extremely difficult, but very interesting. This is by no means an easy A, but it's worth putting the work into because it's so interesting and different. He gives review sheets which are really helpful, but you have to know so much for the exams that it's overwhelming. The lectures are boring, but necessary and they really help.", 
            "Read the texts and listen intently to Railton the next day. Even though his presentation gets boring, his examples and explanation really do help. He even posts his lectures online before class starts. Overall, it's easy to ace as well as fail.",

The lectures don't prepare you for the exams, and instead you should focus on reading the book. He was nice enough as a man, but I would suggest taking it with someone else."

            "The material is hard for engineering students not so good at math, so he shouldn't be blamed too hard for confusing students in lecture. However, he could have improved by teaching less material in more depth. If you take machine learning with him, I recommend watching Stanford lectures on YouTube which helped me understand the the EM algorithm.", 
            "Great class overall but a lot of work.", 
            "The class was poorly organized and tried to go over an insane amount of material by leaving much of the actual proofs and coding up to us. HWs weren't graded until after the final, and took up way too much time. To do well, the professor argued for showing up to both lecture slots which was way too much of a time commitment.", 
            "Evaluating this professor has been left as an exercise to the reader, just like all of the reasoning/proofs that should have been mentioned in his 445 lectures", 
            "I haven't visited his office hours, so I'm not sure whether he helps students well. However, this class used piazza to answer students' questions. (There were lots of articles but it's quite useful.) I think his teaching was not good and other students would agree with me because less than 50 of 200 students came to lectures.", 
            "Overall great professor. The lectures are too fast. The professor want to mention everything which makes nothing is explained completely clearly. HW is very good for you to test and improve the understanding of the material but it's WAY TOO MUCH. I spend much less time on my STATS PhD course than this machine learning one. Take it if you have time.", 
            "Really funny, awesome guy, and he makes the material fun and exciting! Definitely the best professor for this class!", 
            "Great Professor and Performer. His juggling is quite impressive. Took a subject that could have been boring and made it much more interesting and enjoyable. Can talk fast sometimes, but it stems for his overall energy about the subject.", 
            "Good lecturer. Entertaining and helpful enough. Found the book to be the most helpful resource. Exams were difficult but the class has a decent curve.", 
            "I still have no idea how I passed this class, but professor Abernethy made it much less miserable. His lectures were fun and entertaining, which is probably rare for how difficult the material is.", 
            "Professor Abernethy is hilarious. He makes tedious and annoying material entertaining and enjoyable. 203 was not my favorite class, but Professor Abernethy is wonderful. Go to class and do the homework. His review sessions before the exams are also very helpful", 
            "Abernethy is an incredible lecturer that makes the subject matter interesting and lecture enjoyable to attend. He's absolutely hilarious and knows how to keep your interest given his past experiences as an entertainer. He is also one of the few professors who cares about teaching and about his students. Definitely take him if you can.",

            "Best professor ever. If you're taking 203, get him! Made me laugh in every lecture and jokes aside exceptional teacher. Turned a possibly dry and really difficult subject into a relatable and even enjoyable class.",

            "He juggles the way he teaches: decently. Joking aside, he's a wonderful professor teaching a tough class. Even as a hetero male, I don't find him painful to the eyes. I would definitely take another class with him again.",

            "Jacob Abernethy is a rather stellar fellow - firstly, I was impressed by his Erdos number (I think it was 6). My Erdos number is only 7, but I'm just a sophomore right now. Also, it was cool that he went to MIT. I really like professors who have gone to MIT - they usually turn out a bit bonkers, but that's probably for the best.", 
            "Professor Abernethy is a great guy and really enjoys the subject. The class is definitely not easy, however. I studied a TON but only got a few points about average. Great professor to struggle through the material with! His juggling will make your day.",

            "Dotie understands the material and the structure of Chem 130 very well. However, she often doesn't give helpful or detailed answers to questions that students have. The iClicker questions are incredibly helpful in determining how well you understand the information, but it makes attendance mandatory and they're often \"trick\" questions.",

Often than 50% of the class would get a question right, and she would ask \"why did you get that wrong?\". Went to every class, did all the reading, homework, clickers, failed every exam... I was in the slc group too. Print lecture notes!", 
            "Chem 130 is a pretty hard class, but Dottie is a pretty funny lady. She can be hard to understand, she does have an accent and speaks quietly. She's pretty fair with the clicker question, if the percentage that gets it right is pretty low she'll go over it as a class and re-open the question.",

She does not particularly stand out as amazing, but nevertheless her understanding of the material is solid, her lectures well planned and presented, and her engagement with the students enough to keep her students from falling asleep for more than a few minutes.",

If you do well on one exam, you'll be fine if you bomb the last two. It's gen chem so it's going to be annoying.", 
            "Exams are pretty rough. Attendance counts, and your correctness on i-clicker questions matters. Sipowski is really helpful if you make an effort, but she can be a little harsh when you ask questions. Pay attention and it'll be okay.", 
            "Do the OWLs; they help a lot. Just do Problem Roulette before the tests, and you'll do decently. There's no curve. The tests are just 25 MC. There are iClickers. In my opinion, her accent makes it really hard to understand what she's saying. Also, her class was kind of boring, but what do you expect from an introductory chemistry class.",

He is so excited and passionate about Econ and about teaching, which makes it a lot easier to pay attention and learn. I wish I could take every Econ class with Ed.",

            "If you can take a class with him, take it with him. He makes learning economics very fun and helps clarify difficult/confusing things in class. He always happens to know what students tend to get and not get. If possible, get to know him as he is very fun to be with during office hours. However, the exams do tend to be a bit on the hard side.",

I usually can't pay attention in lecture and need a textbook, but he made lectures clear and engaging and did not have any filler information. Would definitely take again",

To do well, definitely make sure you read the book and study a lot before tests. But, Cho is a hilarious, great teacher. Would absolutely take him again if I liked Econ, lol",

Also there's a list of approved student tutors on the class Canvas page, too. :)", 
            "Brenda is a sweet woman. Lecture is very slow but if you pay attention you shouldn't have an issue with getting a decent grade.", 
            "250 has definitely changed and is no longer a blowoff. The HW's can be tricky, MWrite is dumb, and our E1 avg grade was a 53/75 compared to 69/75 last year (NO curve). This class was still very very easy (just not a joke) if you put in just a little bit of time. Lots of freshmen to pad the bottom of the grading scale.", 
            "Despite past students telling me the class was easy, the class curriculum has changed as of recent, and the material isnt a breeze to internalize. I wouldnt call this class easy, but I would say the work you put into it accurately reflects how you will do in the class.", 
            "Gunderson is probably the best prof for Stats 250. As long as you follow along and go to class, you'll be fine. A doable class if you put in some effort.", 
            "I love Brenda! She's like the cool aunt I never had. really know how to teach Statistics.", 
            "Gunderson is good, but 250 is tanking my GPA due to unnecessary nitpicky point deductions on exams.", 
            "Even though I did not register for her class, since everyone (regardless of which professor you have) has the same exam and there are no lecture iclickers that count for grades, I always went to her lecture. She is the professor by far for stats 250, so even if you do not register for her class, go to her lecture or at least watch them online.", 
            "If you have to take Stats, everyone knows Gunderson is your best bet. She was a good lecturer and clearly cares about her students' success, and she's also really endearing. However, be warned that Stats is not really a class that depends on your professor. You can go to any lecture you want anyway. Your success is dependent on the work you put in.", 
            "Horrible overrated professor. Her reviews on here are not accurate. The class is extremely challenging and not one to blow off.", 
            "Great teacher, although monotone voice sometimes, she explains all concepts really really well. After watching her lecture videos, I can see why she's regarded as one of the best professors in the university. Best stats teacher by far. Class as a whole isn't too difficult if you're good at memorizing and knowing how to use your formula sheet.", 
            "Great professor, especially if you're an incoming freshman. Good at making a big class seem small.", 
            "Dr. Gunderson is one of the most articulate professors i've had at Michigan. She presents the material very well and goes at a perfect pace. She provides lots of extra resources to make learning stats enjoyable.", 
            "She was such a sweet and friendly person and by far the best professor for Stats 250. She was extremely helpful during office hours and actually wants the students to do well. There are many professors for this class, but I would highly recommend that you go to her lectures- great teacher!", 
            "Just get your hands on practice exams and understand the concepts behind them, utilize drop in SLC tutoring (for homework help and concept explanation), and rewatch gunderson lectures that's how I got an A when I took Stats Winter 16 :)", 
            "Gunderson is a good professor, try to make sure you attend lecture even if they are recorded. She's the most popular stats teacher, a must have. She's fun, yet tends to move fast."

            "Pretty boring class. Doesn't really engage the audiance, doesn't really care about the class; only his own research and the research of his friends. You even have to buy his own textbook. Do not recommend", 
            "Least favorite prof at umich. Wastes time in lecture talking about nothing, lecture slides are unhelpful and he doesn't even post them, told us not to major in PoliSci. GSI worksheets are full of grammatical errors. This class is pretty much \"Math&Graphs; 140\" with political science thrown in every few weeks.", 
            "first day of class and I already want to drop. listen to the other reviewers. he is very digressive. nothing he says is relevant to the course. he talked about everything from epistemology, socrates, then spent 30 mins jabbering about proofs. people in the class were looking at each other in disbelief that this was his lecture. worst class ever.", 
            "I don't know what the negative comments are about here; Proff Clark assigns complex yet easy to understand reading material, has great lectures if you care at all about political science, and has amazing insight. HW not too bad, exams a bit tough but read and do the hw you'll do fine. Would definitely recommend!", 
            "His lectures were off topic and barely covered the material we were discussing in the book. This class is definitely a self-teaching course. I never went to lecture, and did average on the tests, just by reading the book.", 
            "I LOVED this class. Professor Clark is great and truly cares about the subject. The textbook is one of the few that I have had at Michigan that has truly been useful. This class is definitely worth taking if you are looking for social science credit, looking to learn more about political science, or are thinking about majoring/minoring in the area!", 
            "Awesome professor, this guy is also really funny. If you want a to truly learn political science, and not just take a bunch of survey classes through your college career, then take one of his classes. I don't know what other people are talking about, This guy will give you an extremely substantive education.", 
            "Bill Clark's sense of humor did not click with mine at all, and I learned close to nothing from lecture. Everything you need to know for exams are in the textbook and from your GSI, if you get a good one. Not a difficult class, but one of the most boring and annoying lecturers I've had at the University.", 
            "I had this dude at NYU 5 years ago. He's a decent man but has no ability to engage young college kids into Poli. Sci or to get us to think like him. You Michigan people should be grateful that you didn't have to fork over $34,000 per year to take this man like I did. Buyer, beware when you take this guy. Go Wolverines!!", 
            "This is a great professor if you are truly interested in the field of Political Science. His class is way more substantive then other courses. His lectures are clear, and the work is reasonable. If you plan on going into political science, this class will help you more then any other intro classes.", 
            "Very interesting. He does a very good job lecturing during class. He does a good job separating the wheat from the shaft. However, he tries to teach too much material over the course of the class; he's still used to teaching a 1:30 hour class. Be prepared to also get lectures from the GSI. Homework assignments are a joke.", 
            "Worst lecturer ever-boring and makes absolutely no sense. It doesn't help that half of what he says is completely worthless. The textbook is the one he wrote, and is just as bad as his lectures.", 
            "If you have this professor get out of the class while you still can.", 
            "Make sure you attend class regularly, and use as many office hours as you can. All the books read like technical instructions, but Professor Clark is great at throwing out all the \"useless\" info and stressing only the points that matter. Exams are quite manageable but the papers are quite a chore. Prepare to work hard on them for your grade", 
            "Very interesting course, fair exams and grading on the papers... plus Clark has a sense of humor! Don't take this class with anyone else (Franzese).", 
            "This guy is hands down the worst lecturer I've ever had. He's not clear, and he's annoying, especially when he digresses, which he often does. He's never prepared for lecture . Just don't take a class with this guy. You won't like him or your grade.", 
            "This man likes graphs. He will put a graph up, and then make up a formula. Will this formula be on the test? No.",

            "i think this is a really good class--it is really tough but I really have learned alot of game theory-- If you want to learn this material i recommend but it is not for everyone", 
            "The class is definitly not for everyone but if you like knowing the resons behind political ideas, then this class is great. I absolutely love it. If you like thinking about things in an analytical way, then this is for you. But, if you're more of an english/ history person. It's not."

He is an extraordinary manager and an exceptionally pleasant personality. People don't realize how busy this man actually is before passing comments about him. He cracks some 'geeky' jokes in class too!!", 
            "This course was replicated for a graduate class but taught as an undergrad class. General concepts with no application to the real world. Grading is different and you are forced to use social media even though it is against your will.", 
            "Truly the worst professor ever. The class is incredibly unclear, and he doesn't even teach. You must learn on your own outside of class and lecture is led by GSIs. Could not meet with him once throughout the entire semester.", 
            "Arrogant and condescending (even though insists on us calling him just \"Paul\"), this professor clearly needs some training in getting his ideas across to people while respecting alternative viewpoints. Doesn't bother with homework, group projects, nor participation, he just grades everybody on midterm and final.", 
            "The class has clear grading criteria and Paul is obviously very intelligent in the field. The exams are easy if you actually do the homework on your own without looking up the answers online. He also offers extra credit and drops your lowest homework assignment. Exams and the final project are worth most of your grade.", 
            "Definitely have to work hard for the grade. Go to lecture and office hours as much as possible. Problems sets due every week and you should definitely study hard for the 2 exams. Final project is going to take a lot of time and he really doesn't help much when you ask. He just makes you figure it out. GSIs are super helpful in section though.", 
            "Yes, this is a hard class, but I'm so glad I took it as my first intro to programming, which is difficult to learn and even harder to teach. Resnick did an OK job with that. Take this class for actual learning and don't expect an A without working for it! Office hours were helpful and you learn a lot by helping/collaborating with other students.", 
            "I'm surprised by the comments below; homework problems were fairly easy, and he gave multiple extra credit assignments throughout the semester. Never coded before, never went to office hours and did well. As a social science person, this was the most useful class I took in college, so don't let other reviews deter you!", 
            "This class is not an intro level course. Spent 30+ hours on the project, and countless hours doing weekly problem sets. I will actually be happy if I get a C.... I have never felt so helpless and frustrated in a class.", 
            "This class was absolutely HORRIBLE. It is false advertised as a beginner's coding class, but it is extremely difficult to understand the concepts without some prior knowledge even if you put in hours of work and effort to try and succeed. Resnick is not a good professor in the slightest because he doesn't know how to teach at a beginner's level.", 
            "Hardest class I have ever taken. The work load is nearly impossible. He skips over the confusing and hard concepts. Tests are incredibly hard and don't follow previous practice exams. Assigned us homework, a final project, AND a final exam all in the last two weeks of the course. Worst teacher ever. DON'T take if you don't need to.", 
            "Genuinely cares about his students' success. Yes it's a hard class but that is because the content is hard not because of the teacher. Expect to work and not get an A, but if you go to his office hours you will do significantly better. Really admired him as a teacher and person.", 
            "Professor Resnick was a great professor. He made learning python very enjoyable. The textbook is online and is extremely helpful. He is eager to answer any questions students have and is a super nice professor. I learned a ton from taking this class!",

They are willing to meet with you and work 1:1 on problems you have. This class kicked my butt because I didn't use them as resource early enough.", 
            "This class is really hard for me so far. I have no prior experience with Python and the textbook was good until they just threw us into the actual program completely blind. I have no idea what's going on right now and I'm just praying for a C. The teaching is eh. You're in better shape if you've had prior experience.", 
            "I don't know why people are upset about this guy. He's genuinely concerned about the understanding and hence success of his students, he's a really great guy (albeit a bit shy), and an interesting lecturer as long as you make the effort to tune in. This is his first time teaching SI 106 (previously EECS 182), and he's doing a fantastic job so far.",

It's not hard if you go to every lecture, if you get behind and don't go to office hours to catch up it is easy to start doing really badly.Every lecture builds to the final project", 
            "This is not an intro course. If you have not had computer programming in the past skip this class or you will spend a large amount of your time trying to catch up with the professor. Spent countless nights with the GSI's who were very helpful. Year end project was impossible and was extended because students could not get it to work. Very hard!", 
            "he was alright at explaning the materials and we had fun class activities. However, the three papers which determined your grades were graded really tough because a grader graded it. Definetly the toughest SI class i've taken so far.", 
            "Here's the truth about SI 182: If you are coming in with prior programming experience, the class is very easy and you will genuinely enjoy learning all that Paul has to teach. If you are taking this class as an introduction to programming, it's HARD. Still got an A-, but you really have to dedicate yourself to the cause. GSI's were helpful"

            "Bob is an exceptional instructor, and he cares a lot about how his students do in the course, and that reflects on everyone's overall performance. He gave us many opportunities to check our understanding of the material, like take home quizzes and frequent office hours. I found this course to be one of my most enjoyable courses because of Bob.", 
            "Bob Lutz makes sure everyone is on the same page and his motivation is contagious. Those who show up to lecture and office hours will do very well in the class.", 
            "Bob is a great lecturer. He is always teaching material in a way that keeps students engaged and paying attention. He cares about students learning, and doesn't limit that to just math, he would always throw in random trivia to make us more well rounded individuals. While attendance is not mandatory, you do not want to skip calc 2. You will fail.", 
            "Extremely good at explaining content, and has great understanding of it. Willing to help kids and very patient. Also super funny and makes class more enjoyable because of it.", 
            "I definitely recommend taking Calc 2 with Bob. He's a real cool guy, he's good at lecturing, and likes to tell amusing stories in class. Plus, he really wants his students to do well. Overall, a great teacher.", 
            "Great guy, kinda dark humor but is a pretty casual dude. Took his class Spring Term and he made it clear that missing a class would put someone at a significant disadvantage due to how quickly classes progress. Wrote the tests and frequently pushed us in the right direction if we were spending too much time reviewing a non-important concept.", 
            "Hands down the greatest GSI of all time. If you're taking any math class, especially Calc 2/Math 116, there is no better GSI out there. Pretty chill dude too.", 
            "This class is incredibly difficult, but Bob manages to make it manageable as well as entertaining! He is super funny and teaches in a way that makes sense. I took this class during the spring semester and it was at such a fast pace, but he powered through the material and formatted it into comprehensible concepts.", 
            "Bob is truly an amazing GSI. He cares so much about his students and will do whatever he can to help. He hosts a ton of office hours and is willing to meet even outside of those. He is the most involved instructor I have ever had at UMich. 10/10 recommend", 
            "Bob lutz is a great teacher and his class is easily the best math class I have ever taken. He clearly has refined his methods to near perfection which makes the content enjoyable and clear.", 
            "Easily the best teacher I've had at Michigan. Deeply cares about his students and their success, both academically and personally. He will do anything he can to help you reach your full potential. Very fair, and honest when he makes mistakes. Has a big personality with humor that will make you look forward to class and enjoy learning calculus.", 
            "Bob was the best math GSI I have ever had! He went above and beyond to prepare our class for every exam by holding many office hours and exam reviews. Bob also made excellent use of class time. After lecturing the class on a topic, he would give exam style practice problems to make sure we understood the material and did not fall behind.", 
            "Easily the best class I have taken at this university so far. No GSI I know of holds more office hours or actually cares about their students more than Bob.", 
            "Bob knows what he is doing and is enjoyable to listen to. Goes on interesting tangents which keeps students interested.", 
            "He's a great teacher. Teaches you what you need to know and teaches it well. He's tough on you and you do a lot of work in class, but it's worth it, and you can definitely learn a lot in this class.", 
            "I wholeheartedly recommend taking Calc 2 with Bob! He's got teaching this class down to a science: he does a stellar job of preparing students for the exams, and he goes above and beyond to help his class succeed. He is also very funny and easy to get along with, provided that you put in the effort to learn the material.", 
            "What to say about Bob. This GSI will go above and beyond for his students. He holds many more office hours than any GSI i have ever, and it's because he actually care about you and how you are doing. He wants you all to succeed. His knowledge and drive will make you want to do well in the class. Could no have done it without him. HIGHLY SUGGEST", 
            "Bob is by far the best teacher I've had so far. He expects his students to work hard but he gives you so so so many resources, from packets to many office hours. He takes difficult concepts and phrases them in a way that makes them easier to understand. There's no way I would have succeeded the way I did in if it weren't for Bob. Take his class!!", 
            "Really excellent instructor with funny and interesting lectures, will do everything he can to help you. Take his class, you won't regret it.", 
            "Bob will make you WORK. But that's okay, because you'll find yourself starting to love it. If you take his section, you're almost guaranteed to pass the class (and likely score above average). He'll feed it to you straight, and tell you exactly what you need to know for the test. To top that, tells a lot of great stories that make class more fun."

I learned so much and see the world in a new perspective. FYI I had a learning curve bc I had not taken any comm courses prior, which might have made it a bit more difficult.", 
            "Professor Valentino is very passionate about his field and it shows through his instruction. His lectures are interactive and engaging and his positive personality and enthusiasm is contagious . He also presents his lectures in a balanced and non-partisan manner. He truly cares about his students' success and wants everyone to feel included.", 
            "Great class. You can tell the professor has an interest in the subject. I liked how he treated the material in a non-partisan way. Grading Criteria was clear except for the term paper which was murky due to the leeway we had on our topic. There is alot of reading for this class and it is not uncommon for specific points to brought up in discussion.", 
            "One of the best classes I've taken at UM. Topics are very interesting & relevant in the present politics/media environment. The presentation of lecture material was engaging and unbiased. Professor Valentino and GSI's make themselves very accessible and it's easy to know what's expected to earn good grades. Highly recommend.", 
            "Professor Valentino is passionate about the subject of this class (Mass Media & Political Behavior) and it shines through in his lectures and makes them very interesting. He cares about getting to know his students. It taught me a lot about critical thinking and research methodology. Lots of reading & project is daunting but they provide guidance.", 
            "I took PS329 & he was my honors thesis advisor. He is insightful, inspirational, & approachable. He gives remarkable lectures & his class is fair. He has high expectations & challenges his students in an encouraging way. I highly recommend taking advantage of any opportunity to engage with him in class or as a research advisor. He is incredible.", 
            "PolSci 329 was my favorite class this semester and it was especially interesting to take it during the 2016 election. Grade in this class is based on midterm, final, final paper, section assignments, and attendance. Grading is strict and reading is heavy in this class but I do not regret taking it because I found the material so interesting!", 
            "Professor Valentino was awesome. Did a great job of facilitating discussion in class and always made himself available outside of class. You can tell he really loves the material he teaches. Go to class for Iclicker questions. Class is manageable if you prepare accordingly with the material well before the exams. Really great professor.", 
            "Valentino was by far the best professor I have had at Umich. He was clear during lecture, rewarded students who came to class, and made the tests fair if you did the readings and went to class. I enjoyed getting to know him during coffee hours, take advantage of this opportunity because Valentino is awesome.", 
            "Professor Valentino is great! Loved this course! Lectures and readings can be long but they are really interesting. If you put the work in you will get a lot out of the course. Go to his coffee hours they're a great way to get to know him", 
            "Easy, going to lecture is pretty unnecessary if you do the readings, and doing the readings is pretty unnecessary if you go to class. Pick one or the other. Would not recommend buying all of the required books.", 
            "Valentino is a great professor. It's obvious that he loves what he is teaching. He is very helpful if you make an effort to go to his weekly coffee meet-ups or office hours. I loved this class!", 
            "He is the best professor I have ever had. Make a point to speak with him, and go to his weekly coffee meet ups because it is a great way to know an amazing professor. I keep hoping he will teach more classes because I would give anything to take another class with him.", 
            "Professor Valentino is such a great guy - extremely helpful, nice, and willing to go out of his way to help you do well in the class. He also offers coffee with 3-5 of his students every week and it's a great way to get to know him as a person, and/or talk about politics/class information. As for the class itself, it was so-so. Valentino = awesome.", 
            "Excellent professor. He is smart, funny, caring, willing to help and many more great attributes. This is one of the few classes, if not the only one, where I have learned the most. Nick is very knowledgeable and a good person all around. I highly recommend students to take any class with him.", 
            "this guy is pompous and hypocritical. he allows himself to be late but not his students. he hardly uses the textbooks he assigns. i regret taking this class and dont recommend it.", 
            "Most comments on here are about 211 the class and not Valentino. I took an upper level class with him and I have to say he is the best prof I've had at Michigan. He's intelligent, caring, engaging and fair. Nicest guy you will ever meet. And the class is super interesting. He truly cares about his students. Great man!", 
            "The class materal itself is boring, but Valentino made it somewhat bearable. The lectures were at 830 so it was hard to go, but it's good to go to lecture since he doesn't put everything on the slides. Valentino's a funny guy and he's always willing to help you. The GSIs grade the exams unreasonably hard and section is completely useless.", 
            "Valentino really is a nice guy who cares about his students and is more than willing to help out if you take the time. 211 however, is quite possibly the most boring class ever invented, and I really had no idea how lecture and discussion activities related. Unless you're a comm major, don't bother.", 
            "Where do I begin? What an awful pre-req! 8:30am + Valentino's monotone, redundant, boring material = My complete lack of interest in his lullaby-esque lecture. The class does teach to be skeptical of social scientific studies, which is important, however, his delivery compromises the importance of the class. Section is graded tough. A lot of work"

Thankfully she doesn't force you to talk in class, though there is a fair amount of reading and a steady flow of assignments.",

You'll have a better time if you participate in the discussions, and it'll also make the papers easier. Just utilize her if you need help with writing; she's very helpful!", 
            "I love Gina! She's an amazing and very humorous person however, while the content in the class is extremely interesting if you are not a good writer DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.", 
            "Really fun and enthusiastic. This class was super interesting and Gina kept the discussion going. She's super funny and very good at bringing up the \"red-hot\" topics like sexism and racism.", 
            "Gina's a fantastic, enthusiastic professor who cares about her subject matter and respects her students. Lectures are consistently fun and engaging. Participation in class discussion is not mandatory, but it'll make you will want to participate.", 
            "Gina is amazing! Definitely one of the top 3 professors I've had at U-M. The class topic (horror) is already interesting enough, and then she takes it to another level by being witty, entertaining, and caring. She makes a point to learn all of her students names as quick as possible, and leads a dynamic discussion. Oh, and ghost hunters visited.", 
            "Not the most interesting material, she makes it better. If you show interest you will do well. Hard to not get an A if you show her you want one.",

My first class with her was \"American Working-Class Women,\" which was valuable on so many levels: it improved my writing, exposed me to writers whom I wouldn't have read otherwise, and was a total blast. I liked her so much that I'm taking two more classes with her!",

She's overall just a wonderful person and cares tremendously about her students and being the best teacher she can be! I agree that she's a little tough, but if you take her class (which you should), you will grow.", 
            "Overall, a very difficult class. Gina is great and has a real passion for the material. She wants to learn, but there are just a lot of small assignments that make the workload more than a 3 credit class. I learned a lot and am happy I took this class. if you take one with her, be prepared to take constructive criticism. I grew a lot in her class.", 
            "Gina is incredibly enthusiastic, and the class was worth going to everyday, if you're interested in the materials. Moderate workload, but she's a fairly tough grader! Great class overall!", 
            "Amazing lecturer with such passion for the subject; makes learning Middle English simple and, surprisingly, enjoyable! HEAVY workload (2 Major papers, 5 smaller essays, 5 quizzes, 1 Research paper, 2 Translation assignments, 2 Exams) but it's really worth it. People say it's impossible to 4.0 her class but I have in every class I've taken with her.",

            "This class is hands down my favorite course I've taken at UMich. Gina is hilarious and extremely enthusiastic about an already interesting topic. She's a tougher grader but is more than willing to meet with you, analyze your work, and help you tweak your writing skills. This course is probably the most fun out of any other class I've taken!", 
            "Gina is amazing. The class was actually FUN to attend (even without mandatory attendance). She teaches you to really analyze texts and improve writing skills. She is a tough grader on big essays, but VERY approachable and helpful. I would recommend this class to anyone!", 
            "Although the workload is a bit heavy and there is a lot of reading, Gina presents the material in the most accessible way possible. Her humor and passion for the subject is so inspiring and it's crazy how she can make everything relateable to pop culture. As a person, imagine Ellen as a teacher and it's Gina Brandolino inside of a classroom :D", 
            "Everday was interesting and fun. She's so quirky! I learned a little about writing too. Very easy. Quizzes are frequent but easy as well. She is very open about adding or removing texts.",

He is often absent for pain so you get a few days off but when he teaches he throws in a couple jokes, allows questions during lecture, and knows his stuff!", 
            "Quite possibly the easiest class I have taken. Malley is an excellent professor. He really enjoys teaching and has some pretty funny jokes to complement his lectures. As long as you do all the work and pay attention, it should be hard not to get at least an A-.", 
            "Malley was the definition of fine. Psych 112 was not hard at all. It was completely dependent on your GSI. I had an amazing GSI so I lucked out. Beware of pop quizzes they can be very tough even though they are open note. Rest for he class is cake and you're lucky cuz one quiz gets dropped",

Not the nicest guy but an okay class (if its not at 830).", 
            "Professor Malley is really nice and pretty funny. His syllabus is intimidating but reality is the class is very relaxed. He tries to make his lectures interesting. Your grade depends on pop quizzes so you have to show up. The discussion section is basically another lecture.",

            "A very interesting class. Dr. Malley made every topic interesting and easy to understand. That being said it's not an easy class, you really have to work hard for your grade and make sure you keep up on work. I recommend this class for those who are interested in a natural science focused introduction to psychology.",

There are \"pop quizzes\" but he always hinted at when they would be and you were allowed to use any printed notes. Class got out early much more often than not. Overall, great and fun class!",

Put in VERY LITTLE effort and you can get yourself a B. Not hard to obtain an A. 6 pop quizzes graded by your GSI which can go either way. Mine graded pretty easily.", 
            "He is a really funny guy. I was bored because of the content but he managed to make it somewhat interesting. All of the assignments are graded by the GSI's so just get to know them and you'll do fine. I would take it again if I had to but not for fun.", 
            "He was a solid teacher and it was extremely easy to get an A. Your grade is based on 6 open note quizzes and small outside of class assignments which only took about 30 minutes. You will learn a fair amount and lectures are fairly interesting. He sometimes cancels class which was also nice. It is a great natural science credit!", 
            "Dr. O'Malley seemed to care about the material and his students, as he would provide help when asked or if you made a dedicated effort to go to his office hours (they were often cancelled or the times were modified). The material discussed in lecture did not usually correlate with the readings, which was a major cause for confusion.", 
            "Malley gets a bad reputation sometimes as people think he is arrogant. However, although it's annoying that his quizzes contain very specific, complicated questions from obscure parts of reading/lecture, he is a nice guy who appears to care about his students even if he doesn't know their names.

Material is straight forward if you attend lecture. Tons of extra credit. Unbelievably easy quizzes. Memorize dinosaur groups. Got over 100% Final is easy-peasy.", 
            "I really enjoyed the Dinosaurs mini course and I thought the lectures were pretty interesting if you paid attention. The lectures are posted online and there's extra credit. Do the extra credit, and learn the groups of Dinosaurs and their characteristics for the final and this should be a pretty easy A.", 
            "Jeff gives great lectures, although it can be a little hard to focus for the full 1.5 hour lecture. Lots of metaphor and references to culture which is interesting. Lab is a little challenging, but fun and cool. Really nice guy who does really cool research. Can't wait to take another class with him.", 
            "Dinosaurs with Professor Wilson is harder than any of the other 3 NS minicourses I took at UM. It's easy to do well on the quizzes (20%), and there is a small amount of extra credit available. Unfortunately, the final is fairly difficult. Unless you are very interested in dinosaurs, take this class pass/fail and cram for the final the night before.", 
            "I really enjoyed this mini course. Mostly because its an easy A but also because his lectures were quite interesting.", 
            "He led an excellent mini-course - there were no outside reading or assignments outside of weekly quizzes taken online. Plus he gave a fair amount of extra credit too, he was pretty understanding. I did fall asleep a few times because his lectures were a little too monotonous and simple, but it was fine.", 
            "Easy A - just do the short quizzes (2-3 questions) using the posted lectures. No need to attend lectures, can just learn the categories of dinosaurs and read over the exam review slides and you're good to go.", 
            "I thoroughly enjoyed my mini-course on dinosaurs and evolution. Jeff is a great professor. He made the subject matter interesting, lectured well, made sure everyone got a fair grade, and explained his expectations clearly. The complete lack of reading will be a plus for some.", 
            "Jeff's a cool dude and knows a lot. He isn't always the clearest lecture and can be somewhat monotonous, but generally I learned a lot from his lectures and the material he presents is interesting. It's not an easy class, but not terribly difficult as long as you pay close attention and take good notes.", 
            "Jeff was a good lecturer and his exams were very reasonable, mainly covering bigger concepts. He was very friendly and had no problem answering questions. My only complaint it that it took him until AFTER the final to pass back the midterm (which would've been helpful to study for the final).", 
            "I respect and admire Jeff, but his constant condescending demeanor makes him undesirable to be around. He talks down to nearly everybody, including people with more experience than him, and is uninterested in nurturing a growing scientist. But if you can ignore that, he's a decent lecturer and knows his stuff in certain areas.", 
            "I got an A- in this class. I always attended lecture, took good notes, and did the extra credit. The exam was a lot harder than I thought it would be. There were some simple questions but some hard ones too. I studied a lot actually. This class is really interesting and it increased my level of interest in geosci. Plus JAW is hot. Take this class!", 
            "I received a B- in this class after attending every lecture and getting 6 points extra credit. I studied hard, but the exam was much trickier than say, coral reefs. I recommend that you avoid this class if you are the kind of person that is bad at multiple choice exams. On the plus side, Wilson is very passionate about what he does.", 
            "Professor Wilson is a cool dude! His dinosaur class was pretty fun. Your entire grade is based on ONE exam score. The test was kind of challenging. However, there is EXTRA CREDIT! In the end, more people got B's than A's. It's not hard A, just go to lecture and study for the final. He'll even tell you what kind of stuff he'll ask on the final!", 
            "JAW is a great prof. in that he teaches what he knows well. But when it comes to exam time, nothing he has taught clearly helps during the exam. All the times in class he mentions, \"know this material\" and then on the exam, it turns out that nothing he asked us to memorize helped. Take dinosaur class as a pass fail if anything.", 
            "Best class i have taken at michigan. He's so enthusiastic and makes the material very interesting. I never had an interest in dinos prior to this class, but now i wish i could take it again...oh and he looks pretty good in plaid", 
            "I really wanted to take this class because i have always liked dinosaurs, but i suck at science. this minicourse was so hard for one credit. should have taken it pass/fail. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS or if you do, take it for credit!!!", 
            "Fabulous lecturer, incredibly helpful, pretty good looking too. :)", 
            "Some people are saying he is so hot but I just dont see that. Hes a nice guy, but you should pay attention in lecture because without his presentation its pretty difficult to understand. You'll be fine if you pay attention; take good notes."

            "Really smart guy - studied theoretical physics or something like that at stanford. really wasn't made to be an engr 101 professor. get ringenberg. bielajew's lectures were nearly useless - he just plays around with his code. the GSIs were awesome, though.", 
            "The class was very informative and I learned a lot of information. The class handled students of many levels of prior knowledge. I had never coded before this class. The lectures are mostly examples and I learned a lot in Lab. Textbook is past lecture notes that are hard to understand if you have never coded before.", 
            "The Prof is a great teacher. He's very knowledgeable and can answer basically every question you throw at him, and he's very helpful during office hours. Not to mention his exams are arguably the most friendly. He was funny and informative during lecture, but most of the learning was done in lab, so definitely go to that.", 
            "As a freshman with no prior coding experience, Professor Bielajew made the transition into C++ and Matlab very easy. I learned more in laboratory section than I did in lecture, but Bielajew was enthusiastic about teaching coding and did his job extremely well. I feel prepared for advanced coding courses after his C++ preparation.", 
            "Professor Bielajew was great, really funny guy. His first couple lectures were very helpful, after that I mainly learned from labs. His class is admittedly much easier than the other 101 sections, but I came in with no programming experience and now I feel pretty confident in my abilities. I recommend him.", 
            "Class was overall pretty easy. I came in with no experience in programming and didn't struggle very much at all. Professor Bielajew just enjoys breaking his code instead of explaining it. Class was basically a waste, I learned everything from my GSI in lab.", 
            "If you have previous experience in programming the class is terrible. Way too easy as compared to other sections of 101. He also isn't very helpful when you ask questions.", 
            "Bielajew's lectures are a little bit incoherent, and he does not really explain what is behind his codes and programs. Yet he has some funny jokes, and can answer higher level questions. Projects take a lot of effort, but the GSI's are helpful and you learn a lot. Exams are extremely fair, and Bielajew makes sure you are prepared for the exams.", 
            "His lectures were near useless and he never actually taught in lecture. All he did was show us his codes etc etc. He also wasn't very helpful when I went to his office hours once and he made me feel like I wasn't welcome there because I was asking simple questions and wasting his time because he is \"above me\". You learn everything in lab with GSIs", 
            "Bielajew is an okay professor. His lectures are not very helpful to be honest, but the labs are. The online textbook is useless and not well laid out, I don't think I've read it once. The class overall is pretty easy. He taught C++ well but the MATLAB section of the course was awful. Very rushed, he seemed to assume that we knew more than we did.", 
            "Homework can be a bit rough at times but he is very fair and straight forward. You can tell he cares a lot about the undergraduate class. Had more than a few mind=blown moments in this class. If you put in the work you will do well.", 
            "Helpful and means well. His lectures aren't the best, you will have to study on your own A LOT. Don't rely on lectures alone to understand the material. Workload is reasonable, grading is reasonable. Do the quizzes if you want a good grade. Because if you don't do the quizzes your screwed. Makes a lot of corny jokes in class, which can be funny", 
            "Profesor Bielajew kept programming on an understandable level. Not going to lie you have to put in the work but believe me it is worth it in the end. He keeps things fun with the projects and the dude has a good sense of humor. Don't be afraid to go to office hours or talk to him!! He is extremely helpful", 
            "Super easy class. Almost too easy in fact. Even though I got an A, I left the class still feeling like a complete novice programmer. I wouldn't have minded seeing some more advanced topics in the class.", 
            "Very solid professor. His engr 101 is one of the easiest classes I've ever taken from elementary school to college inclusive. My only real complaint is that he let's his GSIs grade you however they want, and my GSI chose to grade on participation. Might as well grade me for penmanship while you're at it.", 
            "Does a decent job explaining everything. Occasionally goes off topic and sometimes shows code that beginners struggle to understand. Book is very helpful and lectures are worth going to. Can be hilarious at times which is a bonus", 
            "Taught C++ well. He made some successful jokes and lots of not so successful ones, but he definitely is great at programming. C++ was good, but Matlab was pretty rushed. He seems to go over a lot of excess material, but his programs are manageable and fair for beginners.", 
            "Great professor, treats the class like what it is meant to be - an INTRODUCTION to programming class. also gives interesting applications of the material.",

Extremely arrogant and not helpful at all. From then on I studied the lecture notes posted on Carmen and only returned to class on exam days and still got a B+ in the class.", 
            "Incredibly interesting professor, made me love Communications.", 
            "Very enthusiastic guy. He can ramble a bit in class, but lectures are still interesting. If you have to skip a class or two every once in a while you'll be ok. He's a very famous communications scholar and is going to Ohio State next year :(", 
            "He's the best teacher ever! I learned so much in his class, and he was very interesting. Lectures are mandatory because he'll put some of the things he mention on the exams. But the class was fairly easy. Great class to take with him.", 
            "Bushman is so interesting and a fantastic professor. He is going to OSU next semester which stinks. His lectures are interesting and he's just an all around great guy.", 
            "The workload was easy. Uses powerpoint slides, but I would recommend going to class because many questions on the test come from random things he says in lecture that are not on the slides. 2 very short papers, 4 50 multiple choice exams. My only BIG problem with this class was I had no idea what my grade was until it was posted on my transcript", 
            "I don't know why everyone else thinks he's great. All he does in class is talk about video games and how amazing his research studies are. He shows pointless clips in class and doesn't tell us why we're watching them. He makes you memorize unnecessary information. You don't learn ANYTHING in his class, but the class itself isn't hard at all.", 
            "It was a good class, definitely makes you think on how you use media. Go to Bagels with Bushman. Kept things pretty interesting. Read the slides and use the study guide for the book and you should be all good for the exam.", 
            "Amazing class!!! I loved every minute of every lecture. I never missed because I never wanted to. He throws some really good video clips, stories, and comics in his lectures and gives great stretch breaks. It is not hard at all just very interesting and engaging and very applicable to the real world. This class was an eye opener and BRAD IS AMAZING", 
            "Bushman is definitely a nice guy, but his classes are basically a waste of time. He spends most of class giving useless information completely unrelated to the class or reading directly off the power points. The class itself could be a lot more interesting, but all he ever talks about is violence and video games. Blah.", 
            "This class could be an hour long. We wasted so much time with activities that had little to do with the subject (VIDEO GAMES) Bushman presents basic information as if it's some amazing new idea, but he really just reads off the slide. He's also really defensive, and very full of himself and his \"brand new research.\" I was really annoyed", 
            "Nice & funny; new textbook so lectures, exams, and studying was fairly chaotic for the first 3 exams-made a study guide, which seems to help. 4 exams total (no finals or midterms). DIS helped clarify some; puts very specific Q's on exam from lecture to make sure students come to lecture. Do bagels w/ Bushman", 
            "No reason not to take a class with Bushman. Tests are straightforward and not hard. He's a really good guy who truly cares about his students. Every now and then he throws in a very interesting video too.", 
            "Great, hilarious professor. You have to go to class to do well, but thats about it... a little studying and you'll be fine on exams though.. Nice guy, GO TO BAGELS WITH BUSHMAN", 
            "Bushman has absolutely no place teaching. He should stick to research. The only reason I went to lecture was to catch the absolutely random tidbits of information that he would for some reason feel the need to test us on, even though it had very little to do with the course. None of his slides connect to each other and he fails to explain anything.", 
            "Bushman seems nice, but for me he got really annoying really quickly. A lot of people say they loved the information learned in the class but I found it extremely boring. This class made me decide against being a comm major and I was really happy to have finished it. Bushman is really repetitive too.", 
            "absolutely amazing!!! I love bushman. he's really funny and genuinely a really nice guy. always looked forward to going to his lectures, entertaining with lots of videos to keep you interested. he is a really good lecturer and also very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. definitely one of my favorite classes at michigan. only take 102 with bushman", 
            "His lecture was far too early and many of the times he seemed condescending and annoying. His textbook was repetitive and the chapters were unnecessarily long. If it wasn't for my GSI, I would have had a much harder time.", 
            "Bushman is in a word terrible. He seems like a nice guy, I'll give him that, but liberal political bias seeps into everything done in class. That combined with the fact that you study zero interesting topics= a class that should be avoided. This class made me decide against a comm major. Oh and Bushman's two year old humor is amusing for one week.", 
            "Overall, a pretty funny and nice guy. He is usually pretty animated and gives great examples of what you're learning about. Sometimes he's a little opinionated, but the material is pretty straight forward. Exams can be kind of tricky - read the italicized parts of the text. Overall a not-so-hard class!"

He is a brilliant thinker and, though his voice can seem monotonous at times, he is actually really funny. He cares about you & is always down to write letters of rec! Go to his office hours!", 
            "Avoid at all costs. It's a 100-level class but it's unnecessarily complicated. Homework is given every week and in all honesty, lectures does not help at all. He knows the concepts but failed to convey them well. Survived the semester because the GSI was very helpful or I would've had no freaking idea what I was doing the whole time.", 
            "The class is a little boring because of his teaching style but tests are really easy and you should get an A if you do the hw and read over the notes/textbook. He is really interested in the topic and he clearly is a very intelligent man. I would recommend!", 
            "Great professor, can be dull but if you pay attention in class you'll recognize how smart he really is. His lecture slides cover everything he says in class, so its not mandatory to attend his lectures. Easy class-great teacher who explains really well one on one, and his tests and exams are super easy because he posts practice tests and exams.", 
            "There's no need to go to lectures. I found myself learning the material through the homework questions. It's an easy class and even when the tests are hard he is willing to curve. He also posts practice tests/solutions with questions that sometimes appear on tests. Homework and textbook is online.", 
            "I took Intro to Logic with Tappenden and did well, but I did well primarily because I didn't find the material to be extremely challenging and was able to teach it to myself. His lectures are dry and he pretty much just recites what is already in the textbook verbatim. Not really necessary to attend lectures to do well.", 
            "Tappenden's lectures can be pretty dull. I found I learned most of the material on my own. I went to his office hours every now and then; he is willing to help and is good one-on-one.",

I am not usually a fan of clearly right/wrong answers. But Tappenden made me fall in love with logic. If I can give some words of wisdom: go to office hours! He is so helpful one-on-one.",

If you want to learn a thing or two about history and philosophy, take his courses because you will not regret it or forget it. Very rare professor,highlyrecommended",

As a result, it's a pleasure to talk to him about anything, even if not related to the course material. The downside is that he processes information so fast it may be hard to keep up with his in-depth explanations. The man is inspiring and uniquely hilarious.",

His feedback was very useful and (in 467) made it easy to obtain good grades. I highly recommend him as a 303 professor, too. 303 exams were open-book and open-note.",

Though at times he is monotone and that makes it difficult to listen, he is super knowledgeable on everything he teaches. He gives great feedback on essays- pretty much if you apply his comments to your rough draft, you'll get an A. He's very approachable, so go to Office hours", 
            "I've taken both PHIL 303 and 467 with Tappenden, and I much preferred his 467 class. In a smaller class setting at a higher level his lectures are much more interesting; if you're interested in 400-level philosophy do not be turned off by his lesser reviews for 303. The guy is truly brilliant and oddly hilarious, and is a pretty easy grader.",

Although I love logic and am a philosophy major myself, anyone with an interest in basic logic should take this class. His lectures may seem unclear at times, but he knows his stuff and is willing to meet and clarify if need be.", 
            "Very erudite and knowledgeable man. Students should be grateful to be in the presence of someone with this caliber of intellect. Lectures can be a bit sloppy, and unless you already know a lot about Nietzsche, you might struggle. Very reasonable grader and overall a very nice guy.", 
            "In 303, everyone complained about how hard it was to understand Tappenden - which is true a majority of the time. But, if you do the work he lays out for you, ask hims questions, and actually try, you WILL do well. He is one of the nicest professors I've ever had, and he really cares about his students. Great guy.", 
            "Tappenden is a really smart, nice guy and very willing to help students. This course was not my main area of interest in philosophy and it was all lecture and no discussion, which made it hard for me to pay attention. Also, there seemed to be half a grade of arbitrariness in his paper grading, but as long as you try you will do well."

            "I worked so hard in this class. It surprised me. I kept rewriting work. Didn't want to stop. Amy gives such great feedback, pushing us to be better than we thought we could be. Come April, I was surprised at the page count. I loved being encouraged to think versus regurgitate. If you like that kind of thing, take a class with Amy.", 
            "I feel heartbroken that Amy left U-M. She was my favorite teacher of all time. I tried to take another class with her this Fall, but found out she's now at Cornell. How lucky are they to have her there! Amy is more than inspirational: caring, generous, brilliant, committed to social justice, able to see goodness in all of her students.",

            "When I started her class, I thought she was disorganized. Later, I realized that everything comes together, but she has a really unique style of teaching and thinking. She is not like any of our professor at U-M. Her approach to Latina/o Lit is especially unusual in a good way.",

Not to mention he is also hilarious and will meet you outside of class for just about anything. I highly recommend him for any class!", 
            "Mr. Christman is the most genuine and caring professor I have ever had. My class had only 8 students, so we got to know him very well. Unlike most other instructors, he genuinely wants to hear your thoughts and feelings on the readings he assigns, rather than just looking for certain 'correct' responses. DEF take his class if you have the chance.", 
            "If you're taking ENG 125, you can't go wrong with Mr. Christman. He is absolutely hilarious, and makes his class enjoyable, even if you aren't a literature person. The class is very straightforward and he clearly outlines his expectations of his students. Class attendance will help you out a lot with understanding the texts and writing papers.", 
            "Mr. Christman is one of the best professors I have ever had. He does assign some readings, but I honestly learned so much in his course. GO TO OFFICE HOURS and get to know him. He cares so much about his students and genuinely wants everyone to succeed. Bonus, he is hilarious which makes his lectures way less boring than most profs.", 
            "A lot of reading (never did one of them). Extremely extremely extremely insightful and will improve your writing if you meet with him. Best teacher I've had at umich so far.", 
            "Christman is the bomb. Not a ton of homework, but you always learn from him and he's got some kick ass stories to tell. He respects his students and talks to you like an equal.", 
            "Phil is a great guy! He has a great sense of humor and is very approachable. I talked to him about all of my papers outside of class and he helped me a lot! Fair grader. All of the info is given in class so don't skip.", 
            "Hands down my favorite teacher. He's such a great human being. His classes are always engaging, and they are ones that I always look forward too. Mr. Christman cares about a community. His classes aren't difficult at all, but I always learn something and I have grown as a writer in his class.", 
            "Mr. Christman was an amazing English teacher! You can tell he really loves his job and cares for all of his students. He is definitely there to help you but sometimes you can't be afraid to seek it out. There are a good amount of readings to do in this class which are all pretty difficult, but they become more clear in class discussion.", 
            "He's a great teacher because he loves what he does. If you're stuck on an assignment, do not hesitate to reach out! The readings are long and sometimes difficult, but he definitely helps you clarify the text in class. His roll questions at the beginning of class help you to get to know your classmates better and provides a more comfortable setting.",

            "Mr. Christman made me feel so much more confident in my writing. He gives awesome feedback on essays, but it isn't necessarily an easy A, you def have to read (but the readings are really cool). DEFINITELY TAKE A CLASS WITH YOU. He absolutely rocks and your writing will improve immensely if you put the work into it!", 
            "Absolutely amazing teacher who keeps everyone in the class engaged. Creates an environment in which you are excited to receive feedback on your essays from him as his comments are top-notch. Although sometimes long, he assigns very eye-opening readings.", 
            "Unbelievable professor. Christman is down-to-earth, funny, and very open with his students. He genuinely cares about all his students and wants everyone to succeed in his class. Workload isn't overwhelming, and he is extremely helpful if you come into office hours. Very good teacher, but even more so, just a fantastic guy overall.", 
            "Christman is the best teacher I've had at this school so far. Such an awesome guy, you can literally tell him all your problems. Wasn't too interested in the subject but still enjoyed the class because of him. Super hilarious and really cares about his students. Fair grader. If you go to office hours he'll help you out so much.",

            "Mr. C is the best! I took his class to fulfill my first-year writing requirement. He's really funny and most of the class is spent with discussion. A few short papers at the beginning of the semester (easy) and then some longer essays (his grading isn't too hard for these, but you should def review & edit before turning in). Some vague essays.", 
            "Christman is the man. If you have a chance to take him for English it will be an enjoyable semester. Just be sure to get started on your papers ahead of time and edit them well. He is a stickler for grammar errors. Very willing to help you with your work and you'll get what you put into this class.",

            "I've never rated a professor before, but this class deserves a warning. The course is marketed as a natural sciences class for non-natural sciences majors, but it is not taught that way. Also, much of the class is graded/you are given feedback by not only a GSI, but another undergraduate student, which doubles the \"hit or miss\" factor.", 
            "Perry is wonderful! The material can be difficult, but if you put in the effort you will see a result. You'll need to pay attention, participate, and make reviews to use on the exams to get a good grade, but the workload is typical to other classes (not to mention you get to choose how your grade is calculated).", 
            "He leaves out a lot of important details that end up on tests. Even though tests are open note you'll only do well if you study and make your own guide. He is not very accessible for questions.", 
            "Lecture is not mandatory, lectures can be live streamed anywhere with a laptop for credit, or viewed at later time to study. Willing to meet with you anywhere. Easy 10 question HW assignment each week, 3 exams are non-cumulative, open note, open computer. No reason that you should end with less than an A.", 
            "This is overall a good course (on the topic) and an easy one (exams are open book, computer, etc.. You can literally get access to ANYTHING. Plus you can DIY your own grade break up.) Perry uses a lot of tech on this course. You can download and review the lecture on your own. Perry's warm and helpful but sometimes not very clear on the materials.", 
            "He is hilarious. I didn't enjoy the subject matter whatsoever, but I really enjoyed Perry. Plus the exams are open book, notes, and internet. You can also watch the lectures on a live stream from your computer so you don't have to physically be in class.", 
            "This course is not hard, but many students did not get good grades. Student who is not good at nature science should not take AOSS 102, because this course is not so straightforward. Try a Bio or Chem class.", 
            "Nice guy! Interesting topic!", 
            "This class is HORRIBLE. I took it to fulfill NS requirement and i regretted it. The only extreme thing about this class is that it's extremely boring. Unless you are passionate about weather do NOT take this class. The prof is a nice guy bit so monotoned and boring. I recommend not taking this class.", 
            "I took extreme weather because I was looking for an easy natural science....it is really not at all east and honestly i find everything you learn in this class really irrelevant. i can barely stay awake during class and its agonizing to sit through--dont take it unless you are ACTUALLY interested in weather.", 
            "This class was great! Perry is funny in a geeky kind of way and the class was structured in an extremely easy way. Perry was always available for questions and he always responded to e-mails as did the TA. I loved taking this class and I learned a lot more than I thought I would.", 
            "Perry is too reliant on technology and it fails much too often. As if that is not bad enough, the GSI for this course has a terrible attitude.", 
            "Took this class winter semester of 2011, and I mostly agree with people--the class sucked. Perry winged it; lecturebook was buggy; exams drew material straight from homework but were graded harshly. The only saving grace were the GSIs actually. Very helpful, responsive, though not experts in the field. Without them, I would have failed for sure.", 
            "He certainly knows a lot as he wrote the book for the class, but he is unorganized and the technology used in the class goes from cool to annoying very fast. The online textbook is a huge pain, and so far the exam grades have been a low C to D averages...with apparently no curve. Class is more sciencey than the description.", 
            "This class is tough. He nailed the class with the first exam. Anything from lecture, previous exams, or text appears to be fair game. The lectures are not detailed for the most part, so the exam was surprising. GSIs are not very knowledgeable either.", 
            "I'm sure he's a nice guy, but his lectures were random and unclear. Still, after getting incredibly low scores on the three exams (56, 70, 68) I managed to get a B in the class. It was a miracle. I wasn't sure he'd curve it, but he did.", 
            "He's totally winging it. His lectures have very little to do with the exams. Whatever material I learned from this class, I got from the textbook. GSIs are clueless. Don't take this if you're just trying to fill your NS requirement. You need more science knowledge than you'd think. I did, anyway. Not worth it.", 
            "Somewhat interesting lectures. I sent him one email and he never replied to it. The GSIs held review sessions, but were confused about a lot of the material which they are supposed to be knowledgeable about. Multiple choice questions are straight out of lecturebook and . The free response answers are very specific and graded extremely hard.", 
            "Professor Samson acts like he's winging it with this class! Exams are very long for only having 50 minutes. Like 4-5 pages of mult choice and 3-4 pages of essay questions. GSIs don't know the subject at all and are almost useless! Very little of the class is actually about extreme weather. It's more sciency than you're led to believe."

She is very caring, I highly recommend taking this class, and I would love to take a class of her's in the future.",

It's just tedious and requires a lot of time to finish the weekly quizzes and assignments. Don't plagiarize--not even from her slides--not even a scientific definition FROM her slides. She will catch you and drive you crazy. Do the extra credit!",

This course makes you work for the A--written homework assignments, quizzes, exams, and optional online assignments for some extra credit. This course is loaded with information but she makes it applicable and interesting. Would recommend, especially for pre-health students.",

Otherwise, Professor Rust is very approachable and a very nice lady, and her teaching works quite well. Though be prepared to pay $100 for recorded lectures.", 
            "Expect to put in a lot of work if you want to do well. She goes through lectures really quickly which makes it difficult for people who print the slides and add to her notes by hand. I didn't find her explanations very useful but the GSIs are good resources. Her slides are enough for the exam, dont buy the book unless you want the extra credit", 
            "Prof Rust was one of the better professors I've had here. Very kind, truly cares about her students. She does cover a lot of material pretty quickly, but there are tons of resources if you do not understand the first time. No clicker so you can watch lecture at home.", 
            "Dr. Rust was an amazing professor. I changed my career path because of this class and her. If you're not good with fast lectures, you are able to re-watch them at home later at a set pace. The homework takes some time but really helps you understand the material. At home quizzes and homework every week. 4 MC exams + 1 cumulative exam.",

She was super friendly in office hours and always gave clear answers to questions. The class as a whole is great and extremely interesting if you're thinking about a healthcare profession. Would definitely recommend.",

Lectures are recorded, there are assigned homeworks and content quizzes, on top of the 4 exams + cumulative. If you're pre-med, this will reassure you you're in the right place. It's hard, but totally doable, plenty of places to get points. Rust rocks.",

Her office hours are very helpful, she is willing to help you out in forums too. Rewatch lectures you had trouble with. Sit near the front and stay engaged. Don't fall behind, its cumulative final exam.",

            "Dr. Rust is moody, condescending and generally unpleasant to be around. I don't understand her high rating. She will help you if you ask for it but treats students so disrespectfully it makes me sick. As I graduate student, I expected much more than the belittling and sometimes childish temper-tantrum emails I received from her. Avoid if possible.",

This has been my favorite class Ive taken at umich. But be ready to put in a ton of work outside of class as well as prepare for hard exams.",

            "Went to class about half the time and came out with an A+. She goes really slowly, so you can miss a class or two a week and not miss much. The first 3 or 4 weeks are just algebra review anyways."

That being said, if you fail the first or second exam, he's one of those profs who is more concerned with your ending grade than your beginning one. Get ready to memorize a million marine organisms.", 
            "He's a good professor. Not a blow off class though--second exam is pretty tough with all the organisms to memorize. If you study a quizlet for maybe 30 mins a day a week ahead of time you should be fine.", 
            "Dr. Lehman really cares about the material, but that doesn't cover up for all the issues with this class. He is very pretentious and takes potentially interesting material and makes it a total bore. Exams focus a great deal on fact vs. theory and little on rest of material. In fact, it's extremely confusing what HE considers fact and theory.",

Pretty much the same questions each exam, in a different context. 2 extra credit essays (more like 5 super easy short answer Q's) which can possibly boost your grade by 10%. Relatively short reading assignments and helpful lecture slides. Basically, if you show up and actually listen you should get an A.",

Exams are manageable with the study guide & good preparation, & it's possible to do well even if you don't pay attention /attend class (though you'll have to work extra hard on the study guide later). Exams sometimes deviate from the study guide though! Overall: RECOMMENDED",

He is honest, with penetrating observations, and an amazing sense of humor. He has a dark side to him, which is just as captivating. His classes are superb", 
            "Interesting class regarding the land of Israel and Palestine. Truly enjoyed myself, but alot of work is required. The weekly quizzes requires you to attend lectures and listen throughout. To obtain a good grade, you should meet with your GSI and discuss your work and progress. My GSI was amazing.", 
            "The professor talks in lecture of an hour and half without a second break. He gives weekly quizzes and his powerpoints are very poor to review, and you better expect to do much more work than other humanities classes. Unless you're already familiar with Jewish history I would not recommend to take this class as it is very information heavy.", 
            "Yaron is by far the best prof. I ever had. There are so many boring teachers on this campus, Eliav calls his class \"the hunt\" (for knowledge), and every lecture is a gem; funny, penetrating, challenges your assumptions, makes you think. Can't believe he didn't win the golden apple yet. He is also very attractive in the intellectual/nerdy way :)", 
            "Eliav is an AMAZING teacher who is so incredibly passionate about the subject. This class gives you a much clear perspective of the history leading up to the conflict in the Middle East. Must take class, if you do the work and go to lecture you'll get an A-/A.", 
            "Great professor. Very enthusiastic and knowledgeable professor. The pop quizzes each week were harder than expected and there can be a lot reading. Overall interesting class with good professor.", 
            "His lectures always make you listen, his stories are interesting and although it isn't an easy A, its a worthwhile class. Besides that, he is very knowledgeable in his field and is certainly passionate in what he is teaching. He also changes your current perspective on the issue of Israel-Palestine.", 
            "Yaron is an incredibly knowledgeable man, and loves teaching his students well. He assigns a lot of reading but it is manageable and often interesting. His tests aren't too bad if you really put in the effort. Make sure to use GSI's guidelines for essays. Awesome class!", 
            "Took this class spring term with 3hour lectures twice a week, but always enjoyed them. Eliav clearly loves what he does and teaches with enthusiasm. He is respected by his students and has high expectations, but if you put in the work an A is definitely attainable.", 
            "Eliav is probably the most qualified and knowledgable professor I have had thus far at Michigan. He really knows his stuff, and presents it in a very understandable way and is always ready to answer questions. He won't be your best friend, but he will give you all the tools to learn a LOT in his class. He clearly loves what he does.",

Lots and lots of reading but he makes it clear that a lot of it is just supplemental and isn't necessary. You have to go to class because his slides are mostly pictures, have to write down what he says.",

The class itself is moderately difficult, and is definitely not one you can go off. There is a weekly quiz in lecture and a weekly HW assignment. Take the class if you are interested in learning the subject, but not for an easy A.",

            "You can tell Sam is a very smart man, and he genuinely enjoys what he teaches. However lectures are very unstructured and don't follow any slides. You have to pay close attention to catch what's important. If you get a good GSI (which i did not) your discussion section will help you acheive the grade you want. You HAVE to go to lecture to do well.", 
            "Sam is really a nice and friendly professor!!! P.S. One important thing to keep in mind is: don't be absent minded during lectures otherwise you will find yourself completely lost, as there is nothing called \"slides\" in Sam's lecture. But even without slides Sam is a great professor! (as long as you are a good student and go to lectures, lol) :)", 
            "While Sam is a nice guy and pretty funny sometimes, I really didn't like this class/his lecturing style. Don't take this class if you don't like Linguistics, and especially don't take it if you learn better with visual aids because there were no powerpoints at all! Overall, don't take this class if it's just for your distribution", 
            "Sam was the best professor I had in my first semester of college and I wasn't even that interested in the Linguistics department. I'm a film major, but Sam's energy and passion about the topic made it much more interesting to learn about and go into more depth. Would love to take another class with him", 
            "Sam is honestly one of the coolest professors I've had. However, he does not use Powerpoint slides so you need to jot down notes during lecture + pay EXTRA attention because your notes will be your only reference. Lectures are discussion-based so you're free to interrupt and ask Qs. Homework are really helpful, exams are alright. Take the class!!", 
            "I love Sam! I want to do cognitive science because of this class, and he has been such a caring adviser through the process. He's so funny, sweet, and his lectures are so interesting. Some people don't like how he doesn't have slides but honestly just get over it haha and calm down because it's amazing and makes you think like never before.",

He has published papers, and he really knows what he's talking about. The class makes you think deeply and question what you think you know. Highly recommend.",

One day, I had a question about the LT(BL) of bats, as I was wondering if the acoustic disturbances made by bats could be transduced into language, and we got to talk about bats for like six-and-a-half minutes. He also knows the head honchos like Chomsky. Chomsky is my man.",

Other than that, he was funny, the course was fascinating, and I wish he'd teach the rest of my linguistics courses.", 
            "Sam is a really chill guy. I had a question one day after class and we ended up strolling around campus talking about random things for an hour. That being said, he's not a very good lecturer. His lectures are really repetitive and confusing, especially for being so early in the morning. The class is easy though; there is hardly any work.", 
            "Sam is a great guy who really knows what he's talking about. If you have questions, he will definitely answer them. He really seems to understand students. His lectures are interesting, but my only complaint is that they lack structure and are quite repetitive. Overall, if you come to lecture and take decent notes, you will probably get an A.", 
            "Sam is AMAZING. He understands his students better than any professor I've ever had. He will answer all your questions and make sure you do well, as long as you put in a marginal amount of work. Even though the class isn't strictly structured, it's HARD not to do well one exams and homework. You don't have to do the reading, just show up to class.",

Plus, my GSI barely spoke English and was horrible at explaining things. Would not recommend as an intro class.", 
            "I took Ling 209 with him. If you want a good grade in the class, you HAVE to attend lecture. There are no online power points, and it is important to have notebook paper for drawing. But, he is clear in what he says, and he makes sure people understand what is going on in class before moving on. Only homework, midterm, and final.",

This can be a problem, however, because Sam tries to answer every question and often goes on tangents.

Poor organization; homeworks were often posted late and with errors. Is willing to help you in OH though.",

            "He is the GOAT. Most amazing class, and most amazing teacher. So kind, so inspiring. A must take- both for the experience and for your GPA!", 
            "Professor Flint is one of the rare teachers that cares about his students just as much as the subject that he has dedicated 40 years to. As shown in the numerous reviews before this, Professor Flint is one of the greats at U of M. I could not have selected a better course.", 
            "Flint is by far one of the kindest, most caring profs I've had at UM. He known how busy students are, so he's very flexible with attendance and lenient with deadlines. He even offers outside of class learning experiences such as inviting students to attend autopsies (something I would only do once). He also bakes great snacks for us sometimes!", 
            "This class is great for any student. Pre-med for the subject or anyone else for an easy NS credit. The material is fascinating and Andy is a kind and caring professor. You have a case study to review and diagnose before each lecture, take home midterm and final, and one group presentation on a case study. Do an extra for extra credit.", 
            "He is the best. He sometimes bakes for everyone. Exam is takehome. Quiz before class are easy. Sometimes you can go to autopsy trip with him at the hospital which is awesome. TAKE THIS CLASS!", 
            "This was the easiest class I have ever taken. If you need a science credit, take it. The only issue was it was an 8:30 so I had trouble going to class. You are allowed to miss class a few times without it being a problem though. Nicest professor ever.", 
            "Hands down best professor I've had the pleasure of learning from. The sweetest guy who truly wants his students to succeed. He knows so much about his field and is more than willing to share his knowledge (and, on occasion, awesome baked goods).", 
            "Can't gush about Andy enough. Just take a class with him. He loves to bake & would sometimes bring in sconescoffee cake to our 8:30 AM class. He really really cares about his students, and this class is basically a guaranteed A if you show up. Exams are take home and open book so you don't have to memorize anything. HIGHLY recommend to anyone.", 
            "Andy is by far the most genuine professor I have had here at UM. He truly cares about the wellbeing of his students. The class is very interesting and he makes the lectures entertaining. He is really great and I would highly recommend this class to anyone regardless of your major. Great class, great guy!!! Worth taking an 8:30 for!", 
            "Andy is my favorite teacher by far, and I am a Comm major. This class is a great way to fulfill your natural science credit even if you aren't pre-med. You will learn a lot, and the material is super interesting. Andy just wants you to succeed as long as you aren't a lazy bum and his lectures are so entertaining and fun. FAVORITE CLASS EVER!!!!", 
            "Andy is the nicest guy you will ever meet! Class is an easy A and he really wants his students to learn. Get to know him, as he can be a valuable resource for all pre-med students out there! He gives you the book and brings the class homemade food every week. Wish I could take it again!", 
            "Andy is such a great professor. He really cares about the students. He let us out 10 minutes early every class so we could get to our other classes. He makes it clear that if you do well on one presentation, the online midterm and final, and participate, you'll get an A.", 
            "Andy was an inspiring and wonderful prefessor the entire semester. The class is easy going and informative on many diseases. Andy even invited all of his students to his house over Thanksgiving break! He also was able to take a few students to see an autopsy. 10/10 professor and overall person, and I could not recommend this class more.", 
            "Andy is the best! He is kind and very knowledgable about anything and everything. Two online exams are the extent of work outside the classroom. Super interesting lectures. Absolutely the best class out there for pre-med students or anyone interested in diseases. Also, the baked goods are a plus.", 
            "Andy's the best! literally the best class to take if you're thinking about pre-med or any other pre-health related field. Best decision was taking this class hand's down.", 
            "If you want a semester full of fun and relaxation put this in your schedule", 
            "Andy is brilliant, helpful, and so nice. He really wants to get to know all of his students and help them succeed. He even bakes for us every once in a while! Easy A if you put in the effort on the take home midterm and final and participate in class. AWESOME professor. Take this class! You will learn so much and enjoy coming to class.", 
            "Dr. Flint is THE MAN. Never in my life has a man been so nice, so intelligent, and so understanding of young adults. He'll bake everything from scones to brownies, most of his quizzes are open note/book, and he spends an ample amount of time on material. Every incoming freshman should have him.", 
            "Take this class because Andy is the literal best. So helpful and interesting, but easy A.", 
            "I love this class more than words can describe. I have come out of it learning A LOT about human diseases. It helps that the class isn't a high stress situation--Dr. Flint really wants us to learn more than anything else, and I am so sad I cannot continue in his class. Overall, amazing class, strongly recommend!!"

            "Ilya's a heartwarming person, upon retrospection. He really really cares about the students, and lectures VERY carefully to make sure everyone understands, even if the lecture itself isn't always organized perfectly. In this semester, we had a homework assignment every week, but it ended up being pretty manageable.", 
            "Prof. Volkovich is a great professor that always stops for questions, and not to mention, there is a great explanation for each topic.", 
            "Prof. Volkovich is an incredible professor. While I have little interest for the subject matter, he is able to make the course interesting and applicable.", 
            "Really did not like him for 203, but he feels like an entirely new person in 376. His dry, predictable humor is still here, but he's much better explaining the concepts in this class. Lowkey very hot.", 
            "I completely do not know why I go to class. I learn nothing from the class. Just try to read textbook", 
            "Go to lecture, sit in the front, ask questions and take a stab at the bonus questions he asks. This is a sure way to get noticed by Prof. Volkovich. His dry, English-second-language humor is a welcome escape from discrete mathematics. EECS376 is the second class I've taken with Volkovich and he is the reason I was able to do well in both classes.", 
            "Volkovich is a solid teacher who makes the dull materials interesting. He cares about his students by constantly checking to see if there are any questions.", 
            "Professor Volkovich respects all student's questions, and he would answer all of them. The problem is that he uses powerpoint all the time, but showing math on powerpoint is really confusing.", 
            "Ilya is incredibly helpful and really caring! If you sit in the front, he'll always make sure you understand. He does the same for everyone (even in a 300 person lecture hall) and answers every question. Makes dry material palatable.", 
            "Ilya is fantastic! He does his best to apply theoretical concepts to practical applications. His lectures are clear and slides are extremely helpful. The practice exams are great study tools and while the homework is pretty hard, office hours are SUPER helpful. He also truly seems to care about students and to take feedback to heart.", 
            "Prof. Volkovich is one of my favorite professors. He always gives plenty of examples and does so with humor. He is also very good in remembering names.", 
            "Volkovich was a great, entertaining, engaging, encouraging, and funny professor. He always encouraged students to speak up and ask questions. He made funny remarks in class to keep me entertained.", 
            "The course if very intense. Prof. Volkovich does a great job breaking down complicated concepts, he supplements that by telling good jokes. He often stays after class to answer questions.", 
            "Professor Volkovich is a good lecturer. He give many great examples and real world application of the material. He welcomes question and is also good in remembering names.", 
            "Professor Volkovich was alright as a lecturer, but would go over problems that would end up on the exam. However, he was helpful in office hours after class. My biggest problem was that I felt I hadn't gone over most of the material on exams in lecture and had to study the textbook on my own. Luckily the curve is very generous.", 
            "I have to say this has probably been the hardest class I have ever taken in my life. Professor Volkovich tries to teach the material, but fails to go in depth enough to prepare you for the exams which count for most of your grade. I had to put in a lot of my own effort and learn the material myself in order to do well.", 
            "Your average college professor teaching a very difficult class. It may have been more difficult since it was a Spring term class, but still very challenging.", 
            "Professor Volkovich was a good lecturer who would typically take questions from his students and try his best to explain the material well in a hard class. He is definitely a little intimidating and called out students in the classroom, which is really awkward. Overall he was a decent professor, but probably would not take again.", 
            "Theoretical material was never my cup of tea. Prof. Volkovich tries very hard to make the students appreciate that material. He attempts to get the students engaged by always encouraging to ask questions. \"There are no bad questions\". I can see why some students may find it intimidating at times. Overall, I enjoyed his instruction.", 
            "Volkovich is a decent lecturer, but can be very confusing at times. My biggest problem was that he was very rude to students and would call them out during class. If you answer a question wrong or are unfamiliar with a concept then he will single you out during the lecture."

            "Trevor Hyde is the best math teacher I have ever had. I'm not even in his class but I go to his lectures every day because he is so good. He explains everything so clearly and goes over practice exam questions as you learn each topic so that you are very prepared for the exams. He's hilarious; go to his lectures even if you're not in his class.",

If you're willing to put in work to learn, he's willing to put in work to help you. He's one of the best math teachers I've ever had.",

Before class even started, he sent an email to all of us in the summer asking to introduce ourselves. He really cares about getting to know his students. Also, his emails WILL MAKE YOUR DAY! He loves math and made calc 3 a lot better.", 
            "Trevor was an incredible GSI. He went above and beyond to make sure we not only learned a lot, but enjoyed our labs as well. He created a stress-free environment and his passion for math was infectious. He's great in office hours too. If only every GSI was as good as Trevor.", 
            "Trevor was THE MOST incredible GSI I've ever had. He was caring, funny, and took the time to make sure you not only passed but understood the material you were being tested on. I'll truly miss him going forward in my other math classes", 
            "Trevor is the best GSI I had so far at U of M. I feel sad about the fact that I won't be able to have him for higher level math courses.", 
            "Passionate, caring, and funny instructor. It is obvious he loves math and wants to help you gain the best understanding of the material that you possibly can. His explanations are clear and will give you insight in to the inner workings of the theorems and concepts you are working with. You'll also probably get a few laughs out of lectures.",

            "Trevor is such a great guy and really cares about how we are doing. He is super accessible if you need to ask him any questions at anytime, even if that is an email at 1am in the night. He is also super funny and tries to make math not so lame. He genuinely loves teaching and I would definitely recommend this guy.",

            "He actually changed my way of viewing math as a whole. He made it fun and helpful to understand the material. His dank emails also put a smile on my face when I was dreading going to lab so early in the morning. He is the reason I made it through this class and I will thank him for that constantly.", 
            "Pretty sure he has a degree in dank memes. He's a funny dude, good explainer, and is willing to redesign the antiquated, passed-down parts of the class that are probably left over from the Taft administration. He's a great teacher."

Most people know her from her large mini-courses, but I would recommend taking a smaller sustainability/oceanography course with her. Her lectures are very clear, and so are the rest of the materials she presents.", 
            "Gives long, overly-technical, and just generally difficult-to-understand lectures. She makes it nearly impossible to take notes due to the sheer volume of information thrown at you in one class period, so you are left going over the minimally-helpful lecture slides on your own time just to feel like you understand what she is trying to teach.", 
            "Professor Arnaboldi's first-year seminar- Coral Reef Dynamics was a very interesting course. She is very knowledgeable about the field and was good at answering questions and explaining things if you didn't get it the first time. Exams and presentations are straightforward and overall I learned a lot.", 
            "I took Arnaboldi for Earth172/Environ111. The class made me think about sustainability on a deep level as well as a day-to-day basis. She's a very nice woman and makes it easy to succeed. All of the information is from her powerpoints. She gives out a study guide for exams at the beginning of the semester, so just fill it in. Overall, easy A.", 
            "Easiest possible class. 3 quizzes, all answers directly from the lecture slides, provides you with a study guide that contains all questions. Attendance is extra credit. No homework ever. Labs can be long but nothing horrific. Decent professor, probably would've helped a student if anyone in the class had actually needed it. Slides covered everythi", 
            "Super easy class and a very nice lady. Barely did any work and there was no exams or papers, just six online assignments. Nothing about the class was difficult. Showing up to lecture was extra credit and got a 100% on every assignment. Lecture was not the most interesting but could have been worse and often got other work done in class.", 
            "Dont take this course, Not easy A. The study quizzes are fill in the blanks, with a wordbank. However, the answers are not given until the exam has ended. The exam consists of MC questions and it won't tell you what questions you have done wrong. Have extra credit though.", 
            "She talks too quickly and fits way to much information in one lecture. If you zone out for 5 minutes, good luck. A lot of the questions are about things that were barely covered in lecture. If you are considering taking a minicourse, find a different professor.", 
            "Wording on study quizzes makes them difficult. Lectures are badly put together so it's hard to figure out exactly what she wants to tell us. She's quite brusque and sends around an attendance sheet each day (but I think the attendance points are bonus?)", 
            "All of her 1 credit EARTH courses are amazing for non-NS kids", 
            "Do not take this course. Wording on study quizzes is nonsensical, doesn't allow you to see what you got right and wrong on the quiz, gives access to quiz before all material has been taught. 010 would not recommend", 
            "Michela is rude, unhelpful, not very knowledgeable (her slides were literally from wikipedia and her tests were pictures from google), disorganized, and, quite frankly, overall a terrible professor. No idea why she teaches at UofM.", 
            "Truly awful. Homework does not correlate to coursework at all, the exam was completely random and harshly graded, and she seems to barely know the material she is lecturing on. She has been rude to numerous students and seems completely disinterested in teaching. Based on the amount of work, I don't think she realizes it's a 2-credit course.", 
            "Completely undeserving of status as a UofM professor. Always late to class and doesn't have slides prepared. Her slides and understanding of material are as deep as Wikipedia. She complains that she is too busy with classes to set appointment times, but she does no research nor anything important aside from lecturing, at which she is poor at best.", 
            "Way too tough for a minicourse you expect to come in and just get through. Quizzes online & she gives you the smallest window to complete them (half the time you're able to do it is when a normal person would be sleeping). Came down to the final and the questions were way to tricky for a minicourse. She needs to realize what shes actually teaching", 
            "This class was O.K. quizzes 30% & final 70%. Quizzes are pretty easy, as long as you remember to do them online. it is a mini-course so she talks pretty fast to get all the material in, but is pretty clear in her explanations. She addresses questions during class, but not office hours. study hard for final exam, and GO TO CLASS for notes.", 
            "Literally didn't open the textbook once. Don't buy it. Attend class! Every day we attended we received an extra credit point towards the next test. Whole course was painfully boring lectures and 3 tests with an optional final that replaces your lowest test grade.", 
            "This was way too difficult to be called a minicourse. I ended up getting an A+ in the class, but the exam is 100% of the grade and the questions are so tricky. I walked out thinking I had failed. And she is kind of hard to understand. I would stay away from her \"mini\"courses.", 
            "I took a Coral Reefs mini course with her. She was very knowledgeable and helpful. The final is the only grade, and quizzes are extra credit. I ended with over 100%. Easiest class I've ever taken in my life. And even though I'm really bad with accents, I never once had a problem understanding her.", 
            "Very interesting material that had a lot of potential to be interesting. However, I fell asleep during almost every lecutre. Regardless, I still ended up getting 100% on the final."

He provides clear explanations and usually warns you when covering Quantum stuff that the full explination will come in 311. Was super slow about returning tests, but they were really easy and a small % of the overall grade so it wasn't a big deal to me.",

The class was a little difficult for an intro class. The textbook was appalling, I tried to burn it once but it was too windy that day, so I just put it in recycling.",

My GSI was a much better lecturer than she was, and the material itself was very interesting, but I wouldn't recommend taking a class with Dr. Grayson", 
            "Dr. Grayson is passionate and caring. The Social Psychology she taught is interesting, applicable to real life and easy to understand, but only if you pay attention to lectures and complete homework accordingly.", 
            "Nice lady but often confuses herself in lecture and seems incapable of answering straightforward questions. Her test questions don't make sense and conflict with other material you learn in class. You are almost better off not asking questions, tuning out in class and learning the material on your own. You'll be less confused. Take someone else.", 
            "She's a terrible professor, but this class is so easy. The exams are the most ambiguous pieces of trash ever, but you can sift your way through the garbage to get to the answer. She can not answer questions and her examples are never clear, but the material is incredibly easy to learn on your own when you are studying. Don't read the book.", 
            "Lectures are boring and slow paced, material is pretty simple but she often confuses herself while explaining it. Take this course if you want an easy A, not a lot of work and only two exams, non cumulative. You don't have to pay attention in lecture so you can just do other homework if you decide to go. Never read the book and only skimmed slides.", 
            "Carla is a pretty good professor - her lectures are entertaining, the topic is extremely fascinating, and she cares for her students. I would recommend her above other psychology professors.", 
            "Grayson is obviously intelligent but a sub-par teacher. There are a plethora of identical technical difficulties every class (not exaggerating) which gets in the way of her lesson. Boring lectures because it is the exact same material out of the book. Seems to be lost in her own Powerpoints at times. My advice, take the other professor in Psych 280", 
            "Dr. Grayson is one of those professors that seems to simply read directly off of her powerpoint. For me, going to class didn't give me any exceptional information that I hadn't gotten from the readings. On top of that, she moves along at a pace faster than my liking when it comes to the slides.", 
            "Dr. Grayson was a decent prof but struggled to explain difficult concepts clearly. She also wrote horrible i clicker questions. Tests were difficult make sure you study adequately and look for practice exams online. The writing assignments were fine as long as you used the psych terms correctly. PS: the first writing assignment is on Course Hero(;", 
            "Lectures are kind of a mess and she gets frazzled easily. Her examples aren't very clear and her iclicker questions are often debated by students. Writing assignments can be annoying because the prompts are vague. Exams are pretty easy and straight forward if you go over the definitions and examples she includes in the review sheet.", 
            "Professor Grayson is very intelligent, and knows her stuff, but she has trouble explaining specific topics, coming up with clear examples, and answering students' questions. She is available after class to help anyone who is struggling with material, but she is simply not the best teacher.", 
            "Social psych is supposed to be interesting, but she ruined it for us! She is a terrible professor, and she made her first exam necessarily long, which was quite ridiculous. Most students didn't even have time to process anything- didn't test knowing the material, but instead tested ability to finish a test quickly. Do not take a class with her!", 
            "PSYCH 280 was an average class. Expect to complete three writing assignments that are relatively easy if you can connect the psych terms correctly. There are two exams--both during lecture time--that are largely based on what is said/covered in class. Although the concepts may not be difficult the wording can be confusing. Easy B/B+; Moderate A/A-.", 
            "Not very clear exam questions, but compensates afterwards. Lectures are pretty boring and I found it easier to just read the textbook. Basically a bunch of definitions.", 
            "I found GSI discussions and reading the book more enjoyable/easier than going to her lectures. Lectures were very dry; she doesn't seem to have much variation in the way she speaks. The writing assignments were tedious, and I don't feel they taught me much. Start studying at least 3-5 days in advance, the class is easy but not that easy. Lots of EC", 
            "I learned more from my GSI. Her lecture style is informal, but it makes it much harder to understand the material. I found the textbook to be much more helpful than anything she said in class, and you end up watching a lot of barely relevant youtube videos in class. Pretty meh, felt like a waste of time", 
            "Writes the most awful exam questions. We would go over exam questions in class and people in class would disprove every option, and she would say, \"yeah you guys are right, I can't even write an objectively correct question. I quit.\" She's a very nice lady and all but she needs to refine her material and exam writing skills.", 
            "made interesting material boring. She really messed up the midterm, to the point of having to curve it substantially in order to compensate for timing issues she created. I found the material very interesting, but preferred to learn it before exams rather than by attending the long, dry lectures.", 
            "Unliked by many for her confusing lectures but do the textbook reading ahead of class and go to office hours to clear up and misconceptions. Not hard to get an A.", 
            "Be prepared to do a lot of independent studying. The lecture are confusing and lack fluidity in the structure. Her iClicker questions are often not clear and confusing."

            "The class itself was whatever; what truly stood out were Andrew's riveting anecdotes from his anthropological adventures and his beautiful hair. Take this class if you're a fan of anthropology or luscious locks!", 
            "Took this to fulfill my humanities requirement and thought it'd be an easy A but it wasn't at all. The exams were extremely difficult and there was way too much material covered for a 101 course. Make sure you like anthro if you want to take this course & do all of the readings. It's not a class you can blow off and do well in.", 
            "Don't take this class if you are looking to get an easy A. Although the lectures were sometimes entertaining, he goes off topic a ton. The tests are only 50 mc and have a good amount of tricky questions that will trip you up and if you get 6 wrong ur at a B. I honestly felt like the GSIs wanted us to do bad in the class. Regret taking this class.", 
            "If you are thinking about taking this class as a \"blow-off\" class, it isn't. I wouldn't recommend taking this class unless you are genuinely interested in Anthropology beyond a superficial level. I found none of the material interesting.", 
            "He was a really interesting professor. He had really good stories and makes lecture fun. The class is pretty easy, a midterm and final and one paper. Just make sure you get a good GSI", 
            "He's a nice enough guy, but he makes the exams unnecessarily difficult - much higher than a 100-level course should allow. He also seems to think he's a pastor (his vocal intonations, especially) because his lectures all sound like sermons, which gets irritating to listen to 3 times a week; the lectures drag on to feel much longer than an hour.", 
            "The most entertaining lectures I have this term. Includes funny anecdotes and interesting stories from his time in Jordan. Has unique spins and takes on common \"boring\" topics like marriage, dating, gender, diversity. Interesting ethnographies, less interesting but still relevant textbook. Very fun class, got me interested in anthro.", 
            "Andrew is so FUNNY and so INTERESTING. His lectures are completely essential to the course in my opinion. Anyone who says he goes off on irrelevant rants does not see the connection he makes between his anecdotes and the terms we are learning in class because they always relate. Tests aren't hard, reading isn't hard, its all chill.", 
            "Shryock is a great teacher and also a great guy. If you want to learn more about his specialty I recommend his office hours--he has great insight to offer. He also tells really funny & interesting stories in class!", 
            "Overall, the class was very enjoyable and I enjoyed going to lectures because his stories were always interesting. Even though he may go off tangent many times, he reviews everything you need to know for the exam the lecture before the exam. There is much reading to do as expected with any anthro course. Overall, it is very doable to get an A.", 
            "He's probably the most interesting, cool professor at this school. I went in to this class thinking it was just an easy A, but it was actually extremely interesting. Tests are really easy MC common sense, and as long as you get a 90 on them, A in discussion and the paper, you'll get an A in the class. Studying is just reading the book and his notes", 
            "Do not take this class if you are looking for a blowoff or relatively interesting R&E.; Shryock will go on tangents every lecture about things that do not relate at all to the class. He is also rude and arrogant. A good amount of kids received Bs which is ridiculous for an intro anthro course. It is not interesting at all.", 
            "Lectures are never boring, always engaging, and usually hilarious. In addition to being a good teacher with interesting field work experience, this man is a gifted storyteller and his lectures often resemble storytelling or standup comedy. Plus the class is a breeze if you go to the lectures, which you WILL want to do.", 
            "I don't recommend this class as r&e; fulfillment. As an international student I found all the materials difficult to understand, also you really couldn't get INTO the classes since they're something too far away from my own culture. Plus I got an GSI with a terrible accent and handwriting. Lecs are full of funny antidotes, but not tangent.", 
            "Excellent professor, very knowledgeable, clear and lively. He really cares about his students. I wish he taught another class.", 
            "Overall, I enjoyed his class. His lectures were engaging though they were often off tangent at times. He uses many personal anecdotes in class, but they are amusing. The actual textbook is unnecessary but the reading is important. Not an easy A, but an A is definitely possible.", 
            "Professor Shryock is so awesome! He was just so funny and made the material so interesting. I always enjoyed going to class, & was really glad to be introduced to anthropology by him. The work load is not too bad, but it is not an easy A either. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience & would recommend this class to anyone as an R&E; requirement.",

For some, this may make the class tedious, but if you're highly interesting in the subject matter, you will enjoy listening to him ramble. As a bonus, he is very funny in a sarcastic and self-deprecating kind of way.", 
            "If you have specific questions he is very helpful. It's a shame though that his lectures aren;t much help though. His lectures slides aren't coherent and they don't help you with the IDs on the test. Your best bet is to look up the info online.", 
            "Great teacher and great intellectual. He assigns tough books and tends to make them seem even more complicated when he discusses them but, even if it makes your head hurt, an A is definitely within reach. Probably don't take it if you're not ready to think a lot, but if you are interested in the subject matter you have to take this class.", 
            "Good professor that someone gets off topic and can be a tiny bit condescending, however the subject is very interesting and he's quite familiar with it.", 
            "I thought that Prof. Gaggio was fairly clear and incredibly helpful. The midterm and final were both blue books, but he posts the ID terms that will be tested each week on CTools. As long as you're checking them weekly, you can get the help you need in time and do well on the exams. The MC of the midterm was hard, but it wasn't a part of the final.", 
            "This was one of the worst classes I have ever taken at the U of M. Gaggio is unintelligible -- his slides are a mess and the exams are impossible to study for because you have to teach yourself everything. His \"study guides\" are incoherent. STAY CLEAR!", 
            "One of the best profs I've had. He teaches to the bitter end of lecture, seems to know everything, asks often if anyone has questions. You have to really pay attention, but he kept me awake and wanting to learn more. Yes, he digresses at times, but it's to show different theories (ex: cause of WWI), then maybe adds his own well-informed opinion.", 
            "Absolutely loved him. He knows so much about European history--everything is a \"complicated story\" and he's excited to tell you ALL about it! Lectures were rushed or off topic sometimes but always interesting. Good readings except for Hobsbawm (as he warned us). Did a research project with him and he's chill and super helpful. Will miss him!!", 
            "This was one of the more disappointing history classes I have taken at UM. Dario is very knowledgeable but his lectures are so frustratingly disorganized. They are without a doubt interesting, but they are so vague given his rambling and there is very rarely a \"take home point\" with regards to anything he lectures. The class was still interesting.", 
            "Dario is great! He sometimes wanders off topic but it's only because he knows so much about what he's lecturing on. All of the readings are interesting and useful except for Hobsbawm. He's incredibly enthusiastic and often hilarious in his own awkward way. Highly recommend taking at least one class with him.",

Very knowledgeable and helpful.",

            "Absolutely loved Psych 250 with her! Her lectures were so interesting and engaging. Go to lectures - it is possible to catch up from the textbook/other students but if you go to lectures it'll be much easier, and you won't have to study very long for tests.", 
            "Jodl is so sweet! The class can get kinda boring especially if you take it right after taking 111, but she kept it as interesting as she could. Lots of video clips and anecdotes from her own personal life. This class really is an easy A - show up, take notes, review the study guides, and you'll do more than fine.", 
            "Dr. Jodl is one of my FAVORITE PEOPLE EVER! She is super sweet and incredibly knowledgeable. The class is really easy as well; both exams you get a notecard and the study guide is pretty much the exact exam. Take this class, easy and fun. Take it!", 
            "Take this class with Professor Jodl! Her lectures are interesting because she shows videos and interacts with the students. Her exams are extremely easy as long as you thoroughly do the study guide and take notes in lecture. There are 2 papers but they are over interesting topics and as long as you follow the rubrics, you will be fine.", 
            "PSYCH 250 with Dr. Jodl was such an amazing and wonderful experience! She was a very caring, sweet, and kind professor, and her lectures were very clear and well organized. She is one of the best!", 
            "Definitely take psych 250 with her because you will learn so much. Definitely doable if you are looking for an A. Psych 250 is such an interesting class, and Dr. Jodl makes it even better!", 
            "Dr. Jodl was very entertaining. She related the class information back to her kids. She was very helpful and was overall extremely sweet.", 
            "Provides you with lecture slides ahead of time with blanks to fill out as you go. Easy to follow along with. Shows fun videos in class that go along with the topic. Non-cumulative tests that are easy as long as you do the study guides, read the chapters, and copy the notes in lecture.", 
            "Pretty engaging lecturer and material is largely interesting. She's really sweet in a mom kind of way. Have to attend section but it's easy and basically just group activities. Didn't open the book once besides to clarify a term on one of her study guides. Tests are straightforward multiple choice and there are 2 papers but you get to choose them.", 
            "Dr. Jodl is a wonderful professor! Her lectures are captivating and informative. It's important to read AND attend the lectures to do well on the exams. Her study guides are very helpful as well.", 
            "Prof. Jodl was excellent- her lectures were always interesting and engaging, very easy to follow along. Her guildines and expectations were very clear, and as long as you go to lectures (and pay attention) and study a few hours for the tests, you will be fine. If you're looking for a SS requirement, I highly recommend 250 with Jodl!", 
            "Dr. Jodl is amazing. Her lectures are very clear and she put everything you need to know for the test on her lecture slides, you just have to show up to get some missing information.", 
            "Professor Jodl is really bubbly and sweet. She tries and makes a lot of the lectures interesting by including videos and small activities. She usually takes her time to explain which is nice unless its the lecture before the exam (she goes super fast and skips stuff) The study guides are really useful!", 
            "Professor Jodl is by far my favorite professor so far. She is so friendly and cute! Highly recommend.", 
            "First Year Seminar on Emerging Adulthood. It was a super easy course, but there was a lot of reading and she lectured the whole hour and a half. It was an interesting topic though, so I would highly recommend. Exams were extremely easy (allowed 1 note card) and the group project at the end was graded easily."

            "Prof. De Leon certainly has a lot of charisma and appears to genuinely care about his field, but the constant conflation of sociocultural study and politically left wing ideology is nauseating. Topical social and political issues are frequently expressed as absolute truths rather than objects of discussion. Dissapointingly non-academic.", 
            "Definitely willing to give his all to help students succeed. Exams are very straight forward and do not attempt to trick you. However, do keep in mind this is a legit class and you can not blow it off by not coming to lecture. Does have strong opinions about certain topics so it may feel slightly uncomfortable but that's normal and not too bad.", 
            "I don't know what these people are saying about being boring or too Left. Every lecture he made me laugh, had great in-class clips that were eye-opening and added context to/complemented what we were learning about in class. Yes, he obviously leaned left (ex: discussed police brutality during race chapter), but he's an anthropology professor!", 
            "Jason is hands down the best professor I've ever had. He is so passionate about what he does and that shows when he's teaching (also exams are super straightforward) . Went to every single lecture not because I had to but because I wanted to. It's because of this class that I'm now an anthro major. If you can take a class with Jason, do it!", 
            "Jason's class was a major disappointment for me. I didn't find his lecture to be interesting, nor did I find him professional as a professor. He always took time out of class to try to direct us off of the Trump bandwagon. He is never accessible outside of class, so don't even bother asking him for help. He will shoot you down.", 
            "Get ready for a true roller coaster. De Leon is so left and can't help but exhaust his political views in lecture everyday. He always made us listen to old rock and roll songs/bands, which just left the majority of the mass lecture hall confused amd questioning if we were in the Music department. GSIs suck too(mostly grade ethnography project hard)", 
            "Jason doesn't make it interesting and isn't the fairest professor in the world. He will make you despise Anthropology to the bitter end. Two major exams, a ruthless ethnography project, and a section grade composed of attendance and participation. Take with Chivens. He is better I hear. Uh, I was so glad when this class was over.", 
            "Lectures are interesting as he's very passionate about anthro. Even though lecture slides are posted, go to class -- more context for the exams! He can relate to his students & he's pretty funny. He posts study guides & holds review sessions before the exams. Pick something that interests you for the ethnography project - makes it 10x easier!", 
            "Jason is an amazing person. I didn't go to lecture for the first half of the semester and didn't do so well on the midterm, so I went to every class after that, and realized what I was missing. He makes everything so interesting and relatable. Do the extra credit, go to lecture, go to the review sessions, and make the most of the class.", 
            "Easy class. Very boring. I wanted to be an anthro major this class ruined it for me. He was very political in lecture, which some people liked. I didn't. It was an easy A, but take this class with another professor because the ethnographic project is a pain. Some GSIs are chill, but mine wasn't. Participation is enforced.", 
            "Great class - very easy and interesting . I missed an A by just a few points which I could have not lost by knowing what had happened in class (rarely went to class, ended w/ A-). His lectures are genuinely interesting - go to class, and enjoy it! From learning about the juggalos to covering big race & ethnicity issues - you are in for a treat!", 
            "Easiest class ever. Pretty sure the average was a 91. Don't really have to show up to lecture because he posts all his slides online, but showing up will clarify some things. Two non-cumulative midterms that are both easy, a project that doesn't take long and section attendance. GPA booster for sure. Don't buy the book you will not read it.", 
            "Easiest class I will probably ever take at Michigan. Gave a ton of extra credit so everyone that wanted an A would get one. Exams were extremely easy. Class attendance very optional. I knew most of the information from living life for 18 years.", 
            "Dude is chill. You don't have to go to lecture to get an A", 
            "Jason is a super cool guy since he is young and this class is all about society and cultures. The lectures are pretty important to go to. I skipped a bunch and felt lost before the exams. He is really easy to listen to. The exams are pretty straightforward since you get a study guide. Ethnographic project was not that hard but it all depends on GSI", 
            "Going into this class, I had high expectations. I thought Anthropology was going to be something I might want to major in. However, I didn't have the \"aha\" moment I was looking for. Jason is clearly passionate about Anthro, and he's a pretty good lecturer, but it's nothing amazing. The class definitely is an easy A if you study for the exams.", 
            "Professor De Leon is very engaging and passionate about Anthro 101 unlike most professors. He wants everyone to do well in his class and even holds reviews sessions before both exams. He does have you do a photo ethnography project, but it isn't bad as long as you pick something that interests you. Lecture isn't necessary, but I recommend it.", 
            "Probably one of the easiest class you can take at Michigan. I went to every lecture and they were VERY interesting to attend. He's willing to help and attend the review session! I didn't the first time and I bombed the midterm, but then I did for the final and ended up getting an A as well as on the ethnography. The ethnography project is easy too.", 
            "One of my favorite classes & professors so far! Easy class. Lectures aren't mandatory, but you can tell he really cares about his students. Makes sure the material is relevant to our lives, and there's always some funny video or material to accompany a topic, so it's worth going to lecture. Also hosts his own review sessions!! Great professor.", 
            "Professor de Leon is incredibly passionate about his field, and sparked my interest in Anthropology as more than just an easy class to fulfill requirements. He does have a tendency to get preachy at times, but it keeps the interest up in my opinion."

Bland feedback, teaches from slides, and pretty much one of my least favorite professors at Michigan.", 
            "Rod is a nice guy, no doubt. BUT, he does not hand back assignments on time... EVER. He gave grades back the DAY BEFORE THE FINAL, TWO MONTHS after we turned them in. So, if you want uncertainty about your grade, take this class! He doesn't really care about his freshman classes and for a tech comm professor, his presentations are dry and boring.", 
            "Great professor, hilarious guy. Don't use an empty questions slide at the end of your presentation or he'll actually hate you (and tell you to your face).", 
            "He is a nice guy. If you need help on any assignment he is very willing to meet up to give advice. Grades very easily on presentations; basically showing up and doing the work guarantees you an A. He also is knowledgeable about CS and CE despite being a tech comm professor.", 
            "A nice guy, but not a great professor. He has to teach some pretty basic subject matter tech-comm wise, but the fact that he does the opposite of pretty much everything he teaches says a lot. I have no idea why he stares at the ceiling while lecturing, it's quite bizarre, especially while lecturing on making eye contact...", 
            "Rod Johnson is a boss. Yeah, Technical Communications may not be the hottest subject ever but he sure turns up the heat. He has detailed slides and is extremely helpful with advice when giving feedback. The assignments themselves are clear and they are all announced well ahead of time. Do not take TC497 without this man. Professor of the Year.", 
            "Pretty much everything that has been said about this professor is true. The guy is ridiculously boring and seems at times clueless. Things he'll do in class... emphasize eye contact as a trait of a successful presentation yet he consistently looks at the ceiling, argue for histogram usage b/c we are \"decedents from africa\", horrible analogies", 
            "I don't understand why everyone thinks he's so boring. As someone who usually falls asleep in most of my lectures, I didn't find these \"hard to endure\". Plus he understands his stuff well, is a good guy, and teaches helpful stuff. People complain too much.", 
            "His lectures are hard to endure. Two weeks in a row he didn't give us feedback on an assignment and had to turn it in without any basic guidelines... His excuse was that he was 'busy' or something.", 
            "As a tech comm professor - wow - WORST PUBLIC SPEAKER EVER. Cannot elaborate on anything and is not willing to be there. Very office space like... umm yeah...", 
            "Bottom line, this guy is boring. This is the only class I fell asleep in durring my freshman year. It doesn't help that you already know most of what he's saying anyway. I wish i just had the balls to skip class when i knew he was lecturing.",

            "Scott is an amazing teacher who is clearly passionate about his work. Some tips: tests are based solely on memorization, meet with GSIs for papers, go to Scott's office hours, and be aware of the in-class quizzes he typically springs on you randomly.", 
            "Scott's lectures are pretty interesting, and he's a good speaker. However, the tests are relatively tough in memorization, and require you to know the lecture slides front and back. GSIs will do all the grading so be wary of that too, I lost a bunch of points from not following my GSI's guidelines for papers", 
            "Scott is a nice guy and very approachable to talk to. The problem is his tests. The list memorization (on all tests) is tough and his questions are worded in a confusing way. The material itself is relatively easy but the tests are still very challenging and he creates them to get a B- average for the class.", 
            "Makes Comm 102 harder than it has to be. The material is easy and he's a pretty good/interesting lecturer, but isn't clear when it matters (particularly in review sessions). Tests also have some random questions. Don't really need to read the book because it's the same stuff he says in lecture. Gives pop quizzes so you have to attend every lecture.",

            "Scott is a great guy, I highly suggest taking his classes. Lectures can be a little boring from time to time, but when he is discussing a topic he likes, he gets all excited and it's great to watch.", 
            "Scott is overall a great prof he knows how to connect examples to his material so students can understand. Grades are based on 1 midterm paper and 4 non-cumulative exams. Pop quizzes are common and homework is assigned each week in discussion sections. He's super friendly and if I could I would definitely take one of his classes again",

            "If you thought Comm 102 would be a blow-off class think again. He seems to be the type of teacher who found out his class was easy so he made it unreasonably hard. He makes the test so specific and puts information not on the study guide all over the test. Studied what he told me to and was wildly unprepared for tests. Would 10/10 not take again", 
            "Scott is a pretty good professor, but lectures can get pretty boring regardless of the content. In addition, he gives pop quizzes that aren't necessary considering either reading/looking at the nots online or attending lecture is sufficient to learning the material. However, he doesn't really seem interested in how his students do.", 
            "Avoid if at all possible. His lectures are exact copies of what is in the textbook. Lectures drone on and on, with each passing moment forcing the student to ponder what more productive things they may be spending their time engaged in. PPT slides are boring and succinct, forcing you to reference the textbook for explanations and perspective....",

            "Scott is probably the best professor for 102. That being said, the test questions are extremely specific and therefore very difficult with amount of material on each exam. Attending lecture is mandatory because there are pop quizzes, but very few people pay attention.", 
            "He is a really nice guy and relatable guy, and is a good teacher. The lectures could be boring sometimes and since we're allowed to be on laptops people often don't even pay attention, and he knows this. He gives pop quizzes which are like one simple question, basically to reward people who go to lecture.", 
            "The complaints here are pretty laughable. Yeah, you should attend class (or read slides) for key datesfigurestheories etc. but it's really pretty easy if you take notes. I missed a lot of class & discussion & made a B. Easy A if you try. As for Scott: nice guy, funny too. Plus... I'm a dude, but I'll confirm: he's a real handsome man. Man crush!", 
            "Yeah the guy's hot but also annoying. Pop quizzes in lecture almost to punish those who didn't attend, rather than reward those who did. Exam questions are weird & very specific. If there's a list of datesevents in the slides, you better have it memorized. Study guides are helpful but again, very specific questions. Not terrible, could be better.",

Impossible to ask the GSIs a question without them looking up the answer first!

I'd highly recommend anyone with an interest in history take a class with Dr. Cole",

He acknowledges that 90 mins can be a long time to sit an listen to him talk about wartime Europe, so he does his best to keep his students engaged. I would recommend this class if you are interested in the topic, but aren't taking it for a good grade. Cole and his GSIs are very tough graders.",

GSI are also available and fair graders.",

Grade based on two exams and a final paper, and the GSI did the grading on all of them. Makes you work for an A. I got an A-, but I didn't really read any of the books, so if you do you'll prob do better", 
            "Professor Cole is a good lecturer. I found his office hours helpful. There was a lack of support for the final paper so start early. Overall, I think this class was more like a 4 credit class rather than a three credit class. The reading was tough to get through in the week he gave us.", 
            "Professor Cole is an excellent lecturer. There is a decent amount of reading, but it's a history class. The final paper is a little challenging, but the topic is up to students which makes it better. The exams aren't hard if you review slides beforehand and have done the readings. Class was always interesting and engaging. Take a class with Cole!", 
            "The reading workload is heavy for a 3 credit class. He constantly changed his office hours so it was kind of hard to reach him. Exams were unnecessarily difficult: we had to ID quotes extracted from a book of documents. The lectures were very interesting, but disorganized.", 
            "lots of reading, but worthwhile class", 
            "I loved this course. Part of that was that the GSI I had was amazing, but a lot of it came from Professor Cole. He was an amazing lecturer and a really nice guy. He really cared about what he was teaching, and going to lecture was enjoyable. I was unable to go to his office hours, but he was always offering to help us. Great professor!", 
            "Professor Cole knows his stuff but his lectures are honestly pointless you don't really have to go just make sure you're there at discussion. All the material comes from discussion. Nice guy but lectures were pointless.", 
            "This dude is a dynamic professor. Great lecture style and really knows his stuff. I read other reviews and must disagree with their easiness rating. If you attend class and prepare adequately for the exam you WILL get an A. He is organized, knows what he says in class and then tests on it. Go to class, get an A. Nothing is easier than that.", 
            "one of the best professors at michigan! i never liked history until i took his class! i would take anything he taught", 
            "Great lecturer, Really interesting and approachable. He is really into his subject and does his best to keep lecture interesting. The reading is pretty light in 111 though the papers and the tests are moderately difficult. He gives you to power points after the lecture so go to class and listen/take notes on what he is saying because he adds a lot.", 
            "He's great. His lectures go by quickly. He gives you a study sheet before both exams so you know what's on them. My GSI graded a little tough but the class wasn't overally difficult at all if you put in a decent amount of effort. Prof Cole is a really nice and approachable guy. He makes an effort to know/remember students names which is great."

Professor Winter does deviate from the main topic by telling many historical anecdotes, but this is what made lectures interesting for me. There is a lot of assigned reading, but you don't have to do it to get a good grade, as the main points are summarized in discussion.", 
            "Lectures posted online. Very hard to focus in class though... goes off on rants about things that are not relevant to assignments. Didn't feel like I learned a ton, but was also not too interested in the class. Pretty easy A.", 
            "The most accurate comment below is that he \"recites his slides like poetry\". Despite some interesting topics, the disorganization and failure to focus on key concepts resulted in learning about only the surface of important topic and a lot of unless information.", 
            "Terrible, I am majoring in both psychology and political science and I found not a single one of his lectures interesting. His lectures are dull and do not needed to be attended to do well in the course. Assignments are easy, midterm \"exam\" is a joke. Some readings were alright... but who wants to read shakespeare in a polsci class", 
            "I was really interested to take this class the syllabus material looked great. Very disappointing class. Professor Winter is clearly a very smart man that has done great research however, lecture slides are very unclear. Lectures end up going over psych themes for a few minutes but the rest is him describing historical examples. Very easy class.", 
            "Professor Winter is a very smart man. However the lectures were very disorganized. He would go quite in depth into history and other topics to give context to the main concepts but lectures could have been 10 minutes without this. It was a very interesting class and as freshman engineer it wasn't a very difficult class", 
            "Winter is horrible. All of the material taught within the class could have been taught within one lecture and been done with, and most of it was common sense, too. This class should have been interesting, but it wasn't. Winter rambles on about nothing, and even though I went to lecture, he was rarely engaging enough for me to pay attention.", 
            "Great speaker. Lecture certainly isn't mandatory. One in class essay midterm, one 10 page paper, and a take home exam. Depending on the GSI you may have much more work than other section, but overall this class is fairly interesting and pretty easy.", 
            "He is arrogant and extremely self-involved. He reads his lectures like poetry and emphasizes facts that are insignificant to course goals. His research is bland and he forces the class to read countless articles on his motive theories, which frankly just state the obvious. This class could be very interesting if taught by someone else but it isn't", 
            "this guy is very knowledgeable in politics and psychology. he expects students to skim class material rather than read every word. this is a useful skill in the real world. he is articulate and humorous. his class is challenging but rewarding", 
            "Great Professor! Extremely helpful, especially during office hours. Went in to talk about term paper, and he gave me tons of articles to work with. His research is interesting and he does well to keep both political science and psychology students interested. Go talk to him, it's worth it!", 
            "I was shocked when reading through the comments - Professor Winter has been, by far, one of the most impressive teachers I have experienced at UofM. He is a great lecturer, and has been nothing but helpful when I have seen him during office hours. In one brief hour, twice a week, he manages to comprehensively cover a topic while engaging students .", 
            "I simply don't understand what these people are talking about. They must be confused. The class was OUTSTANDING and the professor was just as good. Very helpful prof and GSIs. Each lecture is very valuable and the readings are interesting. A must-take class for anyone who wants to understand how politics and people operate.", 
            "This is the worst class ever. It makes me sad that what could be wonderful is taught by someone who can't relate to students.", 
            "Atrocious, internally focused professor with no concern for students whatsoever.", 
            "Considering his research on power motivation and leadership, you'd think that he intended to impart some modicum interest or inspiration in his students. Turns out, he doesn't spare a thought to any of his students or staff. His office hours are useless - he'll make you feel inadequate and stupid. His research is pointless if he can't even use it.", 
            "He's a very smart, accomplished professor, and you can tell he knows it. Despite his air of arrogance, he really is a great professor, though the material can be a bit dense. He explains the theories well, and doesn't focus excessively on his own research. OK, he does, we read like 10 articles he wrote. But at least they were interesting.", 
            "dr. winter is incredibly biased and ridiculously arrogant, all seemingly for no reason. the topics are interesting, but all of his republican bashing is distracting and you wont feel like you actually learned anything. students are graded harshly and often without explanation as to what they missed/could have done better.",

Many complained lectures were hard to learn from, but it's mostly cool examples & readings are what you're really tested on. Examples from lecture useful to give you ideas for papers, but lecture probably isn't really needed."

The class is hard because the material is hard, which you should expect since this and 401 are the basis for everything you learn as a econ major. Easy target to complain if you struggle in the class, but its on you", 
            "Good 'ol Javier probably should not be teaching this class. He routinely comes to class unprepared and struggles through reading the information that is on the slides. The exams are difficult due to the lack of example problems in class and they include wildly hard applications of theory. Highly recommend different teacher",

I rarely do well in economics classes, but I did well in large part because of how Professor Cravino taught.",

Furthermore, the exams were very hard, and the class grade was based solely on exams (2 midterms 25% each; Final exam 50%). Exam material and format was very different than both lecture slides and homework questions.", 
            "Nooo!!!", 
            "Avoid him at all costs! The worst class I have ever taken. No specific guideline to follow. Lectures have no organization. Cravino has zero confidence as a lecturer. I had no idea what language he was speaking. Can't believe the university hired him to teach 402. No wonder UM's reputation for Econ dept is as bad as it can get. Next!", 
            "oof.", 
            "Definitely unorganized with his lectures, homeworks, and exams. Pretty bad lecturer. Yes the accent is bad, but what's worse is his lack of clarity with everything he explains.

Lectures are required with clickers but you can get 75% of the points for full credit easily. It was pretty much a study hall for me. Labs were good because it's all done as a group. Ask around for a good GSI.",

            "Hardworking, yet awful and pathetic. During her lectures, she asks you these iclicker questions that you have never been taught before and it is impossible to get points on those, but she always use \"75% accuracy will get you 100% of the points as an excuse.\" GSI grades you for most of the time.", 
            "Professor McNeil was a very good lecturer overall. Her notes are very clear and color-coated and she always emphasized important concepts that we needed to know in detail. There are certain pieces of information that are mentioned only in lecture however, so I would suggest going to every lecture you can attend and not just relying on online notes.", 
            "She was not a great professor in my opinion. Exams were poorly written so the hardest part was just figuring out what she wanted in particular sections of the exam. I had this issue with her all year but it got much worse when reaction concepts were being tested on the last 2 exams.", 
            "Earlier in the semester, I thought her teaching style was pretty good for the concepts that were being taught but as material became more complex, I became increasingly annoyed with her teaching style - she shows you how to do \"examples\" but fails to teach the concepts behind them & many too simplistic.

            "I loved Peggy's class. I didn't consider myself a good writer before taking this class but over the course of the semester she greatly helped me improve my writing skills and my confidence in my writing. She takes a lot of interest in all her students which is really nice and she was incredibly helpful. Listen to her suggestions and you'll get an A",

            "I got an A- on my first essay and an A+ on my second--not because the first was a fluke, but because I learned so much from writing/revising it and reading her comments. Peggy is a wonderful, knowledgeable, encouraging teacher. If you put in some work, you're guaranteed to see a marked improvement in your writing and learn a lot about yourself.", 
            "Do not take this class unless you really enjoy writing. Not too many assignments but the grading was very strict and you often can not tell what you lost points on. Peggy was a nice instructor but it didn't seem as if I got anything out of the class. Find an easier teacher...",

The more you participate, the more she will like you. Go to Sweetland and make sure she knows you've gone- she loves effort.", 
            "If you work hard on second drafts and do careful revisions it is easy to get at least a B+. Peggy is an extremely interesting teacher and she helps you tremendously with you're writing. I would definitely encourage anyone to take this class.", 
            "Peggy is an incredible teacher. Her class was compelling and thought-provoking. She grades pretty hard, yet if you put in your best effort whether or not it be up to her standards, she will give you a grade that reflects your effort. She is always willing to talk outside of class and responds quickly to emails. She is also very laid back. TAKE HER!", 
            "She is really helpful in here approach to how she wants you to write. I always thought I was a good writer, but I can say I am much better now than I was before. If you are getting your FYWR out of the way, take english with her. Only 3 papers.", 
            "She was an excellent professor, very helpful and knows what she is talking about. Highly recommended!", 
            "Very good critic of writing; most everyone in the class improved a lot by the end of the semester. Can play favorites a little bit but if you show up and turn stuff in on time there's nothing to worry about. The assignments were fun and entertaining. Sometimes the readings were boring though.", 
            "Very good professor !", 
            "She will expect a lot from your writing. This is painful but valuable. Dont let her impose her somewhat narrow worldview on your work.", 
            "Peggy was a FANTASTIC english 125 teacher. Everyone's writing improves greatly, class was actually made fun, she really cares about her students, she's brilliant and interesting... great professor", 
            "Peggy is a great teacher and completely committed to her students. Usually available after class and via email. Suggestions for success: Go to class, PARTICIPATE, and adhere to her writing style. She really knows what she's talking about and her class is fairly entertaining.", 
            "Peggy has a lot of suggestions and tips for improving your writing, beyond writing for an English class. The entire class works together, which made it interesting, enjoyable, and unique from any other college class.", 
            "Peggy is kind, fun, and very intelligent and really cares about helping her students improve their writing. Essays are graded fairly. Class consists of three 5-7 page essays and a lot of peer revision and workshopping that ends up being really beneficial your writing."

            "Borgnakke has taught at UofM since the 80s, and is pretty stuck in his ways when it comes to teaching. He will sometimes go off on tangents complaining about the \"younger generation\". He can be helpful if you ask questions or go to office hours, but you have to force it out of him, because he doesn't get that you are just learning the material", 
            "Claus Borgnakke is a very smart professor, and also very nice. However, his lectures tend to be very confusing and hard to follow. He goes through examples very fast- he forgets that the students are just learning thermodynamics and aren't as fluent as he is. Good guy, just not a great teacher.", 
            "Great Professor. The material makes sense if you work for it. Many students had the solution manual available and just copied the homework. If you have it I suggest doing the homework and then checking your answers from there.", 
            "Absolutely awful in terms of grades. I did 10 to 20 points above average on every exam and ended up with a B+", 
            "Definitely loved the class. Lectures are a little long, and sometimes confusing. You must read the textbook before you come to lecture though. That'll definitely help. He's very helpful at office hours and the tests aren't too bad", 
            "Claus is an oldschool type of professor and a genuinely good guy, however, I had difficulty following his logic and his notes were quite confusing. I (and many students) were lost until about a week before the exam when I read the book and caught up. Material isn't too bad, but I recommend reading the book to reinforce lecture ideas.", 
            "Borgnakke WROTE the textbook so he obviously knows his stuff. The lectures are long, but he usually makes jokes and he's a pretty funny dude. If you do the homework every week and know the material, this class isn't too hard and Borgnakke does a good job of relating what we learn to the real world so I would highly recommend his class.", 
            "Very clear with lectures, was very interested in subject as well. Exams can be tough but are very fair with what is taught. Ready to help and gives good examples in class that are helpful for homework and exams.",

            "His grading is really hard if your trying to get an A, but if you're aiming for a B-, B you can get that. He curves so majority gets B and very small amount gets As. I learned everything from the book he wrote. Learned not much at all from the lectures. His lectures are really boring, occasional funny moments. DO NOT TAKE HIM!", 
            "He has an awful way of grading exams and the class. His exams are really hard, concepts and problems we never solved. The grading is super inconsistent. Two people could have the same wrong answer and the same explanation, one could get 15/30, another 25/30. I DO NOT RECOMMEND HIM!!!!!! Actually though, AVOID HIM.", 
            "Hands down worst teacher I've ever had. None of his notes are headlined. His lectures are basically solutions to thermodynamic questions, little to no definitions or explanations. Completely uncoordinated with GSI's. His exams are random, hard and contain situations never done before. Smart man though(he wrote the textbook..)just not a good teacher", 
            "Borgnakke is a great professor in the classroom- he explains material clearly, works through many examples, answers questions, and generally keeps class interesting. Outside the classroom, however, he is disorganized and frustratingly unreliable, not scheduling midterms until the prior week, not coming to office hours, and never replying to emails.", 
            "I recommend him and found him to be very fair and lenient. His textbook is very helpful as well. He usually starts lecturing before the lecture technically starts and often lectures past the time it's supposed to be over though.",

I stopped going to lectures, though, because she'd read right from the slides and would only talk about China and the lectures had nothing to do with the exams or assignments and I felt like I wasn't getting anything out of it. My GSI made all the difference tho and is honestly the only way I passed the class.", 
            "Lectures aren't exactly exciting, but certainly clear and informative. She discusses China often, which some students may find annoying, but I didn't mind. The exams are pretty easy. She assigns many lengthy, in-depth readings. Sometimes this feels rewarding and sometimes it feels like a chore.",

She spent a lot of time talking about China, and was pretty tough to reach outside of class, especially because she usually does not respond to e-mails quickly.

Just read the textbook and take notes, skim the additional readings, attend discussion, and you'll be fine. Lectures are extremely boring and not very helpful. OK class overall.",

            "Her lectures were interesting, detailed, easy to understand and the content was well-explained. Do be aware of the grading system--you need a 95% to get an A, which is too high IMO. It's definitely doable, but it gives you little room for error and makes the class far more stressful than it should be even if you know/understand all the material.",

            "Despite what people say, the class is passable. Do all the practice exams multiple times and you'll do alright on the tests. The professor didn't help at all. Lectures consisted of theory for 55 minutes, then 5 minutes of application. Mostly confused me more. Be prepared to teach yourself.", 
            "He won't particularly help you get an A, but you definitely still can. Actually do the homework and find a good GSI's discussion to go to. Stay on top of it and you'll be fine. He's a better prof than most people say.", 
            "Econ 401 is a difficult class to begin with, but Kuhn makes it even more difficult. He is not very good at explaining the material, although his lectures would be interesting if you already knew the material. Wait for another professor if you have the choice or expect to hire a tutor or spend many hours in office hours.", 
            "Not too bad, actually. Better than some give him credit for. Generally well organized, lecture notes posted before class. I find your own interest in quantitative econ makes all the difference. Definitely ATTEND CLASS for a good grade.",

Yeah thats right, the one and only JAN GERS. She aint that great. The subject is just not well taught at Michigan, but overall Kai was much easier to understand than Gers.if ur not an econ maj,dont bother", 
            "Worse teacher ever! can't possibly get any worse. I got the most out of this class by going to office hours and discussions and doing homework. Lectures only confuse me on the material! He is really bad at teaching!", 
            "The professor can not explain even the most basic problems. Lecture is pointless but luckily the material in itself it not that hard.", 
            "I got an A b/c I worked through all of the homework problems then went to discussion. Discussion is where I picked up all that was relevant in the class. Lecture only helps to get you through the homework. Discussion is by far the most key aspect of success in this class.", 
            "Horrible teacher, unclear when lecturing focusing on aspects not important for class or exams. Exams are mostly math yet lecture is rarely if ever focused on math portion making homeworks, which are very long, extremely difficult. Hope someone else teaches 401 for your sake.", 
            "Easily the most difficult class I have taken...EVER. Kuhn goes through lecture at notable speed, and assumes that you have a VERY comfortable understanding of all prior topics. Information learned in lecture is disconnected from homework. Exams require a 20-30% curve. Really, if you are not an Econ major, skip this class.", 
            "This is a tough class. I think people attribute the difficulty of the material with poor teaching, which isn't true at all. I had prof Charlie Brown for a couple weeks and he was a MUCH worse teacher. Prof Kuhn is a solid teacher- blame the curve, not him.", 
            "I just did not get his method of teaching, I never understood how he went from one topic to another!", 
            "This class is traditionally very difficult for many people. If you pay attention you will be able to pick parts of the 80 mins lecture that will help you. HW doesnt really help at all because the tests aren't like the hw at all. Do every practice exam for each test and go to every test review you can. If you're smart you can get an A.", 
            "Horrible at explaining nearly everything. He assumes everyone in the class is as informed about microeconomics as he is and teaches the class as such. Don't bother with lecture just print off the notes but go to section, the GSI's are amazing and the only reason anyone passes.", 
            "Lecture time is where he simply imposes on the class how much superior he is by using all technical jargon and not breaking the topic down into simple terms at all. Skip lecture, go to section, do all the homework, go to GSI office hours, and allow plenty of study time. I could have gotten an A, had I not had 4 exams in 2 days.", 
            "Very hard class, but if ur smart and dedicated, you'll survive. His lectures are not great, so make sure to do the HW, pay attention during section and go to GSI OH."

Unfortunately, I had a really busy semester and wasn't able to spend as much time on the class as I would have liked to, but if I had more semesters, I would absolutely take any class he taught. One of the best professors I've had, and it was my 7th semester.", 
            "Professor Grim is just great and so is his course material. He gives great feedback and lectures span a wide variety of topics in a way that shows how inter-related all topics are. Projects instead of testsmore in-depth exploration of material and less stress. Complex systems is incredibly interesting and he's a master of it. Highly recommended.", 
            "it was great", 
            "Great class. Its format is outside-of-class readings with in-class discussions of those readings and individual projects on the side. I personally really liked the discussions. Lots of great topics. It's a course intended for graduate-level students, but a couple undergraduate students took the class and seemed to not have any trouble.", 
            "Interesting, but not very challenging. This course teaches the foundationbasics of modeling in Complex Systems. Required attendance, readings with online quizzes and projects. No tests.", 
            "When Grim walked in, I could tell this would be a fun class. The guy has shoulder length grey hair, and Indiana Jones hat, and an antique pocket watch! Plus, the only connecting word he uses in place of \"um\", \"like\", etc is \"mmmh\". Oh, and the was really interesting, not too hard, and had a good mix of lecture, reading, projects, and discussion.", 
            "This class is pretty great. Grim is wonderfully quirky, and his lectures are pretty interesting. There are no exams, so as long as you keep up with the homework assignments and like doing group projects, this class should be a fun and easy 3 credits.", 
            "The lectures can be dry but the seminars are typically engaging dependent on the students in class. It really is a class where you get as much out of it as you are willing to put in. The homework are really straightforward and easy. He rarely gives any grade below a 90, he just wants to see everyone trying and engaging with the material.",

            "Is he a friendly dude? Yes. Is he funny and bordering on hilarious at times? Absolutely. Is his class easy? You betcha. Here's the catch(es): He doesn't test on material that he teaches and there's no textbook, so you're reliant on whatever notes you manage to take.GSI also may suck. Godspeed, you'll need it. Average for midterm was a D :)", 
            "Grim is a nice guy who is always willing to help you through email or in person. He knows a lot about a lot of stuff. Lectures can be a bit dry at times, mandatory attendance in lecture & section, no textbook. 20% midterm, 20% final, 20% project, 20% attendance, 20% easy/medium HW. Exams were moderately hard, but curved. Fair grading on all.",

            "I am a polisci major but this class also fulfills the quantitative requirements. Yet, the midterm was hard with a pretty low average, but final grades are curved.", 
            "I took this class to avoid the dreaded STATS 250 & to fulfill my QR. While this class was very trying at times for someone not very math inclined, I don't regret in the least. Grim is amazing, hilarious, and engaging. He's incredibly smart, yet still broke everything down & was amazing during office hours. Get Zev as your GSI! He is equally amazing",

            "This isn't really a Polisci class, mostly complex systems. The class material isn't too difficult, but the midterm wasn't representative of the difficulty of class material or homework. Attendance is 20% and guided lecture notes another 20%, so there's a built in grade cushion. Overall good class, but definitely not political science", 
            "This class was absolutely amazing to take. I learned so much from this class and it changed the way I think about complex questions. Professor Grim is a very engaging professor, who shows so much enthusiasm for his subject and profession. He clearly enjoys the material and it shows in his teaching. I greatly enjoyed this class.", 
            "A great class with incredible material. I struggled sometimes connecting material from class to class, as sometimes there was a bit too much information overloaded in one class, and then it as straight on to different material the next class.

            "Robin is hilarious and definitely knows what she's talking about! The lectures are incredible and don't really rely on the readings at all. She makes everything seem interesting. There are clicker questions sometimes for attendance, and you have to get a certain number of those points to pass. Grading is easy and assignments are flexible.", 
            "Queen Robin truly is fantastic. I never took a linguistics class, but I always felt like I could keep up with the (deeply fascinating) material. Also, make sure to trust the grading system--it sounds confusing at first, but as long as you work steadily through the semester, you will definitely get an A (it's designed for everyone to do well).",

            "Robin is awesome! The class is structured by getting points rather than percent cutoffs, so you can get an A in whatever way you want! She gives fantastic lectures and makes the topic very interesting and thought provoking! It's rare to get a class that's this easy and thoughtful, but Queen makes it such a great class!", 
            "Robin is an exciting and and engaging lecturer. This is a great class to take for an easy A, but only if you are organized and self motivated. You essentially create your own grade by picking and choosing the assignments you want to do. It is possible to achieve an A without taking one exam or writing one paper, which was so great for me!", 
            "This class is SO easy. You get to choose what activities you do and don't complete (and all exams and papers are optional). The subject material is interesting and Robin is a really engaging lecturer. I'm a linguistics major, but you don't have to be to appreciate the class.", 
            "Robin was great! She really engaged students, and made an effort to learn everyone's name. It isn't hard to get all the points you need for an A, and I ended up learning a lot from this class. Definitely recommend!", 
            "Robin's great. She will make sure she knows your name in a big lecture and will challenge you with material that is interesting. Thought-provoking subject and the actual workload is not bad at all. Definitely recommend!", 
            "Robin is AWESOME. You get to pick which assignments you do throughout the semester, so you can play to your strengths. It's basically impossible not to get an A if you keep track of your points well. Class is easy, attendance not mandatory, interesting subjects.", 
            "I loved this class! Although I originally picked it to satisfy Race/Ethnicity, I ended up looking forward to each lecture. Robin discusses hard, uncomfortable truths of discrimination that are really eye-opening and perhaps even life-changing. Only regular assignments were blog posts/comments, which was easy enough. Take this class!", 
            "Robin was an AWESOME prof. She was helpful and really talented at tackling some uncomfortable topics. She is super nice and easy to understand. While some of the readings are long, Robin does a great job helping make sense of them in class. I highly recommend her!",

Her lectures are interesting and engaging; the hour flew by each day. The workload is a little heavy, but it's good because it helps you engage with the material, which is relevant. So glad I took this class.", 
            "Robin is fantastic! Lectures were interesting, class discussion was stimulating and there are no exams. Paper assignments can be challenging because there are a lot of them and she asks for 1.5 spacing. The blog also becomes laborious as the semester goes on but overall, great class.",

Just participate in class discussions, raise your hand a lot, and do the homework. There were no tests/quizzes. Just 9 homework assignments, and a final project at the end. It was a very interesting class as well",

We didnt have a txtbk but we did have alot of readings (2 30-pg ones per week), but its okay if you dont read all of em bc they will be reinforced in the online quizzes that can taken as many times as u want. the exams arent hard if u studied a little. easy, fun, unstressful!",

The reading quizzes were annoying at times, but you can get away with not skimming many of the readings. Also she gives bonus points quite liberally, so in case you were lazy (like I was), you can make up for it and end up with a pretty good grade.",

            "Andy is really nice, but definitely makes you do work to get a good grade. Don't take if you are looking for a class to skip or not do work in. He really likes physics and does a lot of example problems, but the exams he writes are pretty brutal.", 
            "Andy might be unclear sometimes but he's really helpful and is accessible outside of class. You can also ask him physics questions other than the lab questions.", 
            "Professor Tomasch was actually quite a good professor. He made sure we all understood what to do how to do it. He even gave out packets of notes for each lab that really helped me understand 261 and 260 as well.", 
            "Andy is super excited about physics and passionate about his students. That being said, his lectures, homework, and quizzes were on rather simple material, while the exams were on super complex stuff. Don't come into this class expecting it to be an easy A.", 
            "I am not a physics person at all so I took this class to prep for 135235. He seemed to make basic concepts really involved which was confusing. Bottom line, I left the course still confused on a lot of things BUT he was SO nice and helpful if you were having trouble. Would have done much better if I had the time to go see him in the helproom more.", 
            "It seems like 115 students like him, but 235 is a different story. The difference is I guess 115 isn't a weeder class but 235 is. In 235, he expected MORE calc knowledge on exams than the prereqs asked for. You are supposed to understand basic calc concepts, but not be expected to do the actual calc. An exam should never have an average below 75.", 
            "Great professor who is so nice and more than willing to help when you need it. However, don't go into this thinking it is a blow-off class. You need to go to class, do the homework and read the notes online but if you do it is easy to do well.", 
            "This guy is an angel sent from heaven. He is kind, caring, and very enthusiastic about physics. I took physics 115. All you need to do is go to class and ACTUALLY read the notediscussion slides before classes or exams and you'll do fine. I highly recommend him. :)", 
            "poor teacher, doesnt explain things well. terrible lecturer", 
            "Hard class compared to 135. Writes unfair exam questions that require math knowledge beyond calc 1. This class isn't even supposed to be calc based. People taking this class don't even intend on doing anything physics related in the future.", 
            "They tried to make this class more difficult this semester, but Tomasch clearly took it WAY TOO FAR. You were expected to be able do/understand calc 3 and 4 stuff when the math prereq was only calc 1. He clearly expected more on exams than what was gone over in lectures. The coursepack didn't have very many helpful examples. A terrible experience.", 
            "Like everybody has been saying this class has literally been redone to be basically the equivalent of 240. It used to be easier as people taking this class don't intend on choosing physics demanding majors. Had we known this, we might as well have just taken 240. Winn is MUCH better.", 
            "He's great in office hours but not a very clear lecturer. The class changed tremendously this semester. Calc II concepts are fair game, and the exam averages have been far below the historical averages. It would have been nice if Tomasch would have informed us that this class was becoming essentially the same as 240.", 
            "Tomasch made the class very unenjoyable. He clearly wanted the typical intro class grade distribution, unlike in 135 where half the class gets A's. Calc 1 stuff is fair game since it was listed as a prereq, but he expected beyond that on exams. I felt like taking 240 instead may have actually been the better/smarter choice.", 
            "I liked Tomasch at the beginning of the semester--he was upbeat and engaging. But it soon became clear that he expected us to know far more than what he taught. His exams were horrible, his teaching style was unclear, and we had to know calculus for a pre-calc class. You can understand the concepts and equations perfectly but still fail the exam.", 
            "They really redid this class so that it is no longer a joke. Tomasch designed exams to have lower than expected averages with no curve. Most people only care about the grade rather than learning the material as this is a mostly prehealth class. I agree that this is the wrong attitude to have but Tomasch does not seem to be considerate at all.", 
            "Tomasch has been writing exams that are WAY HARDER than they used to be. With the way the grading scale is set up exams should be written to have averages no lower than 70% but they are much lower this semester. This is such a big change from 135. You will really miss having a professor who really wants everybody to get an A.", 
            "Electricity and magnetism is HARD. Unfortunately, Professor Tomasch does not always give very straightforward explanations. He gets very excited about the material, which tends to lead to long ramblings. The test material is largely based on lectures and practice problems. In my opinion, the exams are much more difficult than the ones in 135.", 
            "I actually liked Prof. Tomasch at the beginning of the semester. But when the first exam rolled around, it was obvious that his expectations were unreasonable. BEWARE! This class expects you to know calculus well. His explanations in class are rambly, he doesn't answer questions on Piazza, and his exams are MUCH more difficult than practice exams.", 
            "The class is not too difficult. It is easy for a physics class. He tries to be helpful, but he's not that great of a lecturer."

Although at times you will feel challenged with the content, the course is truly straightforward. She is incredibly intelligent and her passion truly shows. I would recommend any class with Levitsky.", 
            "This class is really enjoyable, and Prof. Levitsky makes it fun to go to. The best way to get an A is to read, and I would advise after your reading that you do a brief summary of the piece, as you will need to know this information for the exam. Keep up with the readings. Follow the essay questions to the T, do not stray from them.", 
            "This class was way too easy not to get an A in I did end up with an A- due to being sick, but this class was an easy A. The exams were somewhat tough. It is crucial to memorize the names of specific sociologists and what their research was on in order to do well on the exam.", 
            "Levitsky is a fantastic lecturer. Her class is very interesting but I found that the less time I spent on assignments, the better grade I got. The key to the papers (6 short essays) is to pick a very obvious topic and to answer the prompt very directly and simply. Exams are easy if you study lecture notes and basic concepts from the readings.", 
            "She's brilliant. Knows everything about everything. Very respected in the Soc department and well known for her work. Super organized and clear. Can't wait to take more classes with her.", 
            "Professor Levitsky kept class interesting at all times", 
            "I LOVE Professor Levitsky. I wanted to go to her lecture everyday and I learned so much. Everything she says is interesting and she chooses her readings carefully. She purposely doesn't have a textbook in order to save you money. She ends lecture early everyday but you won't care if she doesn't. 100% want to take her class again.", 
            "I love Levitsky's lectures. She's brisk, no-nonsense, and covers a lot of material in a short amount of time (we usually get let out 10-15 minutes early). Unlike some professors, she won't pause for a ridiculous amount of time waiting for student responses. Moreover, the class itself is just really interesting! Take if you can. :)", 
            "She was very devoted to teaching. I learned a lot from her class. Love her teaching style.", 
            "Really awesome professor. Energetic, assignments are extremely clearly outlined and graded very fairly. The papers are hard, with strict/difficult page limits, but rubrics are super specific and if you fill the requirements, you're good to go. Bumps your grade up if you are on the edge of a better one and you participated in class.", 
            "Levitsky was awesome, such a great lecturer. I really enjoyed attending and I think you definitely have to in order to retain the information, especially since there's so much. Tests were not bad as long as you study. All multiple choice too. There are a lot of essays that are very short, but graded so harshly by GSIs.", 
            "By far my favorite professor this semester, albeit the left bias. As the others have said, there was a lot of reading and 6 essays, but I didn't find it that challenging. If you attend lecture you get the jist of everything. I barely skimmed the readings and wrote the essays the day they were due. I got 2 wrong on the exams and an A in the class.", 
            "There wer about 6 short papers you had to write but the GSI's were really tought graders. She was really easy to listen to and added a sense of humor when she could. Great teacher, but have to work for the good grades on papers. Exams are all MC and not bad at all as long as you study and do the readings.", 
            "She's a hilarious teacher and really engaged with her students! Loved this course but you MUST do the readings. The Midterm was difficult but the essays weren't so bad. She tells you exactly what she expects of you.", 
            "Professor Levitsky is great in teaching. She makes her class fun but her exams are not very easy. Six essays in total for an introductory class is a lot. Take it if you are ready to read and write.", 
            "Professor Levitsky is by far one of the best professors I've ever had. Her knowledge of the course material and the concise nature of her lectures made a difficult class worthwhile and fascinating. She is always available and willing to help her students, and her GSIs were some of the best I've ever had. I would encourage everyone to take SOC354.", 
            "Sandra is by FAR the best professor I've had at UMICH. She completely inspired me through her lectures. She definitely assigns a lot of readings, but the class was absolutely worth it! Would recommend to anyone that's interested in the law or just inequalities in society in general. TAKE THIS CLASS!", 
            "Professor Levitsky is an incredibly engaging lecturer; her lectures are organized, intriguing and powerful. She is clearly very intelligent, experienced, engaging and funny. She is definitely one of the best professors I have had at the University. She explains legal concepts and applies it to relevant and important current issues.", 
            "Levitsky is a great lecturer. She reads from prepared notes, but she does it well. She also takes time to engage the class in discussing the material in the medium-sized lecture. Unfortunately, that makes the mandatory section feel like a waste of time. Still, it's a good class and you'll learn a lot about the law and legal structures in society.", 
            "Attendance is mandatory, which is rather frustrating. Discussions are a waste of time and there's a mandatory blog part which is pointless. Besides from that, it's a great class. Dr Levitsky is super passionate about this subject and is a really clear lecturer. The material is interesting, and it's an easy class."

Also we had a final paper for this class (first half semester minicourse) and it's been over a month. Still no grades and no announcements....? Very disorganized", 
            "Thinking of this class spikes my blood pressure. Her workload and expectations are like this is your only course and she'll happily watch you drown juggling work from your other, more important classes. Not improving my Russian. We're learning about useless fairy tales and archaic language. Wish I had taken the other 300 class. I regret so so much.", 
            "Stubborn, gives SO much work & extra reading/learning at home. If you struggle at all, she blames the students & is clearly annoyed. Stand-offish/defensive if you try to ask qus. Unclear assignments & adds homework without writing it anywhere after only mentioning it once. Her teaching style killed my enjoyment in learning this language.", 
            "I took this minicourse because I needed humanities credit, thought it would be interesting yet a light work load. I was so wrong. There was so much reading, especially for a 1 credit course and the iclickers sometimes conflicted with the reading. Very confusing overall.

We have other classes to worry about, & Alina doesn't seem to get that.",

She would constantly change her mind, she did not follow the syllabus, she would sometimes ignore a student's comment during discussion or she would agree with a comment she had just shot down when said by another student. She was unclear on assignments and she never graded on time.", 
            "Good prof! Demanding but fair, always prepared for class, very flexible if you do your bit. You will actually learn to speak, write, understand and use your Russian fluently in two semesters. I am thinking of doing a Russian major after her classes. Don't waste your time on the regular track unless you are after the language requirement.",

You do learn a lot from this class, but I feel that's only due to the fact that you are learning so much everyday so even if you don't master everything you are still learn a lot.", 
            "She is an inconsistent and irresponsible instructor. She favors certain students, is generally passive-agressive, and returns tests and papers back weeks late.

            "Dr. Ward was the best. She's so passionate when she talks. i studied for the exams 1 or 2 days before by just going back through my lecture outlines and I ended up with an A in the class!", 
            "Very knowledgeable in the field of abnormal psychology. Tests are super easy since she gives you a huge review sheet with everything that will be on it. As long as you follow the rubric on essays, you should do well on those too. Pretty easy class for the most part.", 
            "She was very passionate about the material, and an expert in the field.", 
            "Show up to class and study to get an A. Ward is great because she tells you EXACTLY what you need to know for the test - a review sheet w/ exact pages of information you need to know from the book. I found it to be an extremely interesting, yet easy class.", 
            "She's sooo awesome! She is very friendly and she makes the lectures so interesting and easy! The exams are not hard at all. Just study the lectures and you'll do fine! I strongly recommend her!", 
            "Ward is incredible! Best, most clear, and funniest professor I've ever had at Michigan. Wish I could take her for all my psych classes! Exams are really easy, taken directly from lectures, with an occasional question from the book (she tells you what to read in the book beforehand, though). Great professor!", 
            "Dr. Ward is an amazing professor! She does such an awesome job keeping you engaged in the material which could easily become boring. This is a great class, and she's a great teacher! There are four exams, two essays, and mandatory discussion, but it's an easy A. You have to go to lecture, since she doesn't post slides. Great teacher and class!", 
            "250 with ward is like most other psych classes at UM: Money in the bank. Spend the time to go over the notes and you will get an A. Only way to not get a good grade would be to not put in the couple hours a day leading up to the exam to study pretty basic and easy to remember material", 
            "I had Ward two years ago and since then, I have not found a teacher who has exceeded her greatness. She was an amazing teacher. Made the class very enjoyable and easy... AND she came in one day dancing to Rihanna's Rude Boy - how cool is that? It was hilarious! I LOVE HER!", 
            "My favorite class so far. Prof. Ward is very engaging, made me look forward to going to lecture. Exams were very fair, just study the lectures. Professor is very approachable and friendly. This class got me really interested in developmental psych. Definitely recommend taking.", 
            "My favorite class at Umich. Ward was an amazing professor who really knew how to engage the class. Very easy to get an A in her class. Exams are straight from the lecture slides, with very few book questions. She even makes a study guide that promises to include everything that will be on the exam. Overall a great class.", 
            "Professor Ward is really fun! Psych 250 was pretty easy. THERE'S EVEN EXTRA CREDIT! The tests were straight forward. Just study the definitions and concepts. You have to buy the textbook because the tests will sometimes ask a vocab word from the book.", 
            "she is kind and smart. she has conducted firsthand developmental psychology research. she makes lectures fun and presents the material in a relevant and applicable manner. ive seen people walk in front of her after she's started lecture and her demeanor changes 180 degrees", 
            "LOVED her lectures! She always presents the material in a fun way with lots of funny stories and interesting video clips. The exams were easy as long as you know all of the terms. She gives you a review sheet that's also really helpful."

            "One of the better spanish teachers or professors I've ever had but she makes you work for your grade. You need to participate everyday in class in order to do well, but she is kind and makes class enjoyable. Homework almost every day", 
            "This was a great class. She was always genuinely excited to teach and made class fun. I wouldn't call it an \"easy A,\" but the more you pay attention in class, the better you do. She does a great job of preparing students for quizzes/ tests just by going to class.", 
            "Made a difficult class even harder. She doesn't always go by the syllabus, and sometimes teaches the wrong material in hopes to make you go 'above and beyond' even though it's clearly not in our skill set. Expects far too much from her students, and often rudely comments on mistakes in class. I get nervous wondering what could go wrong every class.", 
            "The course material was tough but it was rather interesting. I've always liked language classes where the students get to learn about the habits and trends in a culture instead of just learning the language itself. Juliette assigned a lot of homeworks, but they are manageable if you are not taking a lot of other classes during the semester.", 
            "Juliette is an amazing professor. Her class was the most practical course I've taken in any department at U of M. Not only is she an excellent pedagogue as far as language is concerned, she teaches French culture (both pedestrian and business) in a way that's engaging. She'll make you work for an A, but she genuinely is a great professor.", 
            "This course was amazing! The content is so practical and met every expectation of mine. Discusses and teaches valuable things pertaining to French life (banking, businesses, letters, etc.). Really, really helpful course and the lecturer is passionate and gives good feedback. She also facilitates well the group sessions with actual French students!", 
            "TAKE THIS CLASS. This is the most valuable and informative French class I've had at U of M. Juliette is kind and truly cares about her students. You will learn a lot on French society as a whole and will information that anyone considering working/living in France should know. I would recommend this class over every other French class at U of M.", 
            "At first, I was intimidated by Prof. Moutinou, but I really grew to love her over the course of the semester. This class is TOUGH (although I have no background or interest in business), but overall enjoyable, especially the collaborative project with French students!", 
            "Professor Moutinou is a very tough grader and your grade involves a great deal of participation. Although she is a tough professor, she really knows her stuff. You will definitely have to work for your grade but going to her office hours will help.", 
            "Juliette is one of the best teachers that I've had in the French Department. She demands a lot from her students and assigns a lot of homework, but if you're willing to put the time in you will truly learn French. Her business French course is hands-down the most useful class I've taken and has been essential to my post-graduate plans.", 
            "If you talk to Juliette outside of class, you can tell she really cares about her students and wants them to do well. I really liked her as a person, however, as a teacher -- not so much. Not good at explaining things and never really teaches anything. No help at all when it comes to preparing for tests. Literally all we did in class was go over hw", 
            "The single worst teacher at the University of Michigan. She does not follow the course syllabus or give assignments back on time. She doesn't know how to teach. Put in twice as much work as students with other teachers and received lower grades. Also she constantly belittles students in front of the class.", 
            "I have always loved Spanish but this class was awful, worse than all of my science classes. She assigns huge amounts of work and demands a lot out of her students yet she doesn't prepare or teach the material well. Avoid if possible.", 
            "Use vocab, participate, and incorporate everything you've learned so far in your assignments. If you plan to go far in spanish, she will be beneficial in the long run because she really forces you to learn. If this is just your last language credit you have to take and you don't want to continue with spanish, choose someone else!!!!", 
            "Profesora Moutinou really cares about you as a student. She really wants to see us improve as Spanish speakers, so if that means forcing you to participate and giving you a bad participation grade, she will. With that being said, she puts a lot of time into her feedback. If you actually want to become good at Spanish, I highly recommend her.", 
            "Juliette is such a sweet, kind woman. She's really passionate about the class and Hispanic culture. Things are explained clearly, both content-wise and the expectations. There is homework every night, but it's graded for completion, not correctness. The tests are fair, and she gives helpful corrections on the essays. I love her!", 
            "Juliette is a great teacher. She balances a lot, teaches multiple courses and speaks like four languages, so she doesn't have time for disorganization from her students. She's also French, and my experience with French teachers is that they demand a level of organization and excellence that isn't always demanded by English teachers. Take the class.", 
            "Juliette is an extremely tough teacher. The homework she assigns is completely irrelevant and you basically have to teach yourself the grammar outside of class. She does care about her students but overall she makes an already hard class even harder.", 
            "She is a tough but great professor. She has high expectations of her students. Material is not incredibly difficult but she assigns a lot of homework. There are probably other 232 professors who would be an easier A, but I learned a lot in this class and her high expectations led me to work harder and feel incredibly accomplished by the end.",

But I didn't really care for Prof Cotera. She had a pretty heavy bias during lectures and came off as arrogant.", 
            "EASY A! But--worst class I've taken at U of M. Opinion based quiz questions, little respect for other epistemological approaches. I'm a liberal, and this was way too far for me. Cherry picking data, little critical thinking, 100 pgs reading/week. Lecture required, no laptops. Belittle opinions. If interested in WOMENSTD, take different course.", 
            "Super mediocre course. Lecture was not very exciting and I spent 95% of the ones i actually attended either on my phone or just doodling. Easy grading, just participate in section (25%), skim the readings to do the quizzes (25%), and put in at least some effort on the final project(40%) and you'll get an A even if your midterm essay(10%) is a C.", 
            "It's been a year since I took 240 and I still wish I could go back and take it again. I recommend the class often to people who need a HU credit, but I advise them to wait until they can take it with Prof. Cotera! Her lectures are great. I can't imagine how anyone could teach the class better.", 
            "She made the lectures interesting and I really liked the class even though I don't agree with everything she taught. My GSI was also very accepting of conflicting viewpoints. There are a lot of readings but you just have to skim them for answers to the online quizzes. The midterm is take home and you work on the final project the whole semester.", 
            "very passionate but her lectures only focus on white and black/hispanic feminism (literally a month of reading the same thing) & not very inclusive of other minorities. also a ridiculous amount of reading and grade is mostly determined by reading quizzes which test super specific things from the readings. easy A but u have to put in the effort", 
            "She only lectures half of the semester and the rest is done by GSIs. The readings are a bit boring but you only need to skim them to get good grades on quiz. It is very important to invest effort to section participation and group project (don't make your project boring if you want good grades). Midterm was takehome exam and there was no final exam", 
            "Professor Cotera is amazing and really knows what she's talking about. I learned so much in this class and I'm hoping to take more women's studies classes in the future. Discussion is the most important part of your grade, but also in my opinion the most fun part of class. We talked about current events and issues on campus. Very interesting.", 
            "This class is super interesting and Professor Cotera REALLY knows her stuff. She jam packs the lectures with information, but lecture notes are all online. She takes attendance for 2-3 sections after each lecture, so attendance is somewhat mandatory. There are lots of assigned readings and online quizzes, but not hard.", 
            "You really don't need the lectures. I attended maybe half and got an A in the class, but she does start taking attendance after spring break. Your entire grade is based off of your GSI so make sure you develop a good relationship with them. The weekly quizzes are brutal if you don't read the material, but you'll do just fine if you skim them", 
            "Fell in love with women studies because of this class, decided to minor in it. Would take again.", 
            "The class is easy. I didn't enjoy the class as much as I thought I would have, but I don't regret taking it. Discussions were my favorite part.", 
            "Professor Cotera is an amazing lecturer. The topic of the course is already interesting, but her passion makes the course even better! There are weekly readings for the course that you will be quizzed on. Some of the readings are quite long so be ready to buckle down and crank them out!", 
            "Maria Cotera was a great lecturer and I learned a lot from the class. The second half of the semester the GSIs taught the class, and that was fine. The readings were not hard and the weekly reading quizzes were on ctools and not hard.", 
            "OK class, a lot of reading and the 2 hour sections weren't fun. She only teaches half the lessons and GSIs do the rest. Before taking her class look up her wikipedia page, it should give you some insight on her personality.", 
            "She is an excellent professor! She is fun, lively, and really knows how to engage her students, even on some of the more boring topics. My only complaint is that I wish she had lectured more, instead of bringing in a lot of guest lecturers. Quite a few of them were boring.", 
            "Fantastic prof! Definitely go to office hours! She has really interesting things to say and her lectures are fantastic!",

            "Uher is one of those professors that you can tell is super smart, but you would also like to have a beer with him. If you have him for 140, he'll go through the derivations of basically every formula and concept. Unfortunately, everything seems trivially easy to him, so he doesn't understand when kids are slow to pick up some concepts.", 
            "You can get away only coming to class on iClicker days and barely doing the homework for a little bit but I learned the hard way that you get left behind quickly. Most of his lectures are example problems. He makes everything easy to understand and his handwriting is beautiful! Make sure you understand the homework (not graded) and practice tests", 
            "I took physics 140 first semester of freshman year with professor Uher and I really enjoyed it. I would highly recommend him. He is a good lecturer and definitely go to office hours. They are very helpful and he is pretty funny.", 
            "Really great professor and as far as I know, probably the best or one of the best professors for physics 140. He definitely knows his stuff and does a great job teaching it, it's merely up to you if you choose to attend lectures and attentively listen. He does have a european accent, however, he's still very clear.", 
            "Prof. Uher is helpful both in class and during office hours! He really cares about his students and help them in anyway he can. He explains things mathematically which I found really useful. Also, his reviews are great for test preparations.", 
            "This was a deceptively hard class. Professor Uher is an okay professor in my eyes. His lecture style is kind of fast and he writes on the blackboard to solve problems. I wasn't very good at physics so it was sort of hard to keep up with what he was doing and how he got to solutions. My advice: Go to class and do the bookwork. It will be worth it.", 
            "Prof. Uher wants his students to succeed. Not only are classes mandatory through iClicker questions, but he also provides a lot of details in class that aren't on the PowerPoints (which he posts) that help on exams. The test averages are low, but Uher's section is usually 1 point higher. The class is doable as 35% of grading is effort & 65% tests.", 
            "Great professor! Every other day is discussion where he gives you one iclicker question based on the problems from the night before that are very easy. His lectures are very organized and expectations are made very clear.",

Uher gave us helpful formula after formula, and did practice problem after practice problem - the majority of which ended up on the actual exams.

The day of exams, Uher did example problems exactly like 4-6 exam questions. He gives only 1 clicker question instead of 6, and 97% of the class gets them correct since Uher basically gives the answers out.",

I can see how this would be useful for some, I kinda viewed it as a waste of time. He normally gives hints on what will be on the exam, which is super nice. He actually teaches the material, unlike other profs.", 
            "Though I never had him, I went to several of his lectures and he is a FANTASTIC professor. Get him if you can. He explains things very clearly and he makes Physics make a lot of sense. Tests are still hard, but he explains things really well. Another thing I like about him is that he kind of sounds like Dr. Lipschitz from Rugrats XD.",

            "If you're deciding between taking Yuri Popov's class and Uher's, take Dr. Uher's class! He is VERY clear and thorough, he cares about his students doing well (which is impressive for such large classes) and prepares his classes very well for exams. I was not as impressed with Dr. Popov's lectures. The class is difficult, Dr. Uher makes it less so."

            "She speaks at the perfect speed to listen to, and is a very kind professor. Your papers and exams will be graded critically though, so get your preterit/imperfect and grammar in order. She'll prepare you pretty well for exams, as you do a lot of practice exercises in lecture. Overall, I'd definitely take it with her again.", 
            "She's one of the sweetest people you'll ever meet. I've so much enjoyed having her in class. She loves to get to know you personally. She takes time to explain things that don't make sense. She also has a great sense of humor for being older. Superb lady.", 
            "An okay professor, nothing exceptional or horrific to report. Her class was boring and she was a tough grader. You will never get full points for participation which will really end up hurting your grade. Overall a nice lady, don't expect an easy A.", 
            "A solid professor but, has high expectations of students which is reflected in grading in every aspect. It is very difficult to get full credit for participation.", 
            "Carina is the sweetest! Her voice is soothing and her accent is easy to understand (she speaks slow enough to understand, but not so slow that it's tedious) and will clarify if the class isn't understanding. She has a lot of funny stories and makes jokes all the time. Participation is important, but she isn't too harsh with grading.", 
            "Awesome teacher!", 
            "Carina speaks entirely in Spanish, at least for 231, but will clarify, so nothing is confusing. Most of class is spent talking in Spanish with other students, which might sound weird, but it is actually super helpful and you will become surprisingly decent at speaking Spanish. There is not much homework but the homework assigned is very helpful.", 
            "She is the sweetest women I have ever met. She really care about her students and she likes to make little jokes. Her accent it thick so if you are not good at listening it may be hard to understand, but if you ask her, she will repeat herself. Her english is alittle choppy, but its okay because she is such a nice and caring person", 
            "Great teacher. Always happy to help and is very nice. Makes the class engaging. I recommend her.", 
            "I was a high school senior in 231, and Carina was such an amazing professor and made me excited to come to UM as a college freshman. She's absolutely adorable, and it's impossible not to love and respect her. She speaks slowly, so it's not hard to understand her. She's very easy to reach through email, and she gives good feedback on your progress.", 
            "Carina is such a genuine and kind person and professor. She is from Argentina and doesnt speak much English but she will always speak slow and clearly in class for students. She is really easy going and I enjoy class with her. She will never give a pop quiz. Participation points matter a lot in her class so its necessary to always answer questions", 
            "Carina is awesome, but it's hard to get a good participation grade. She made class fun and was amazingly laid back!!! Great, funny lady!!", 
            "Carina was such an incredible professor. She has such a quiet and unexpected sense of humor, even though she barely speaks English. But she speaks so slowly in Spanish 100% of the time to make sure her students understand. She is also willing to joke around. (We even watched some NCAA Bball games during class for nothing extra in return)!! Get her.", 
            "Carina is a great lady. She was so nice and she actually seemed to care about her students. If you take spanish, take it with her.", 
            "She's an awesome teacher who really cares. I'd highly recommend her for Spanish and you don't really have to do anything in class, just answer a few questions and you get an A", 
            "Carina has good intentions and wants to help students. Although she talks quietly so sometimes its hard to understand her, and the textbook is completely useless and confusing.", 
            "Could not ask for a nicer teacher, always had the biggest smile on her face and made class as fun as the subject material would be. Makes you want to participate, study the material and you will have an easy A.", 
            "Great teacher, extremely willing to help. Definitely recommend taking any Spanish course with her!", 
            "Carina definitely was my favorite professor this semester. She always has a smile on her face and even cancelled class for us the days before fall break and thanksgiving break. The class itself is a little difficult but Carina is very helpful and if you do all the work, an A is not that hard to get. I definitely recommend this class!", 
            "Carina is funny and pretty easy-going. Expect in-class participation but nothing stressful. Does a gr8 job keeping us engaged and fun.Not an automatic \"A\" but if you pay attn (not hard), study, and follow guidelines, not too hard to do well.Fair teacher n would def take another class w/ her again!"

However, it was hard to learn grammar concepts because he rarely went over them during class and didn't always talk in Spanish in class. That being said, I would take it again because I enjoyed the cultural aspect.", 
            "Jose is a fantastic teacher. He makes Spanish fun and really wants his students to do well. He tries hard to make things relevant and uses a lot of media in his teaching which was awesome. My Spanish improved tremendously and I didn't have to work very hard.", 
            "Jose was awesome! Each session was helpful and so much fun. He really got you out of your comfort zone and my spanish improved immensely.", 
            "Jose was amazing. I wish I could take every Spanish class from him. He is engaging and funny and truly makes sure you understand a concept fundamentally before moving on. We had little show and tell's and he seemed to care about us as people. TAKE HIS CLASS. He's fantastic.", 
            "He has interesting lectures and seems chill but don't be fooled. He is a tough grader and it is very difficult to get an A.", 
            "JOSE! He was such a good teacher! If a student needed help, he would always give them personal attention until they understood. He was also extremely funny and I laughed every class! By the time spanish 103 was over, I felt like not only was I leaving a class behind, I was leaving a family behind :(", 
            "Jose is an extremely funny guy that makes every class very fun and intersting. However, probably because he is from Spain, he is not the best teacher for Americans just starting to learn Spanish. While every class is fun, it is difficult to pick up on the actual topics that are needed for the tests.", 
            "Very enthusiastic about what he does, and knows what he's doing. Highly recommended.", 
            "GET JOSE. no homework besides diarios and workbook every other week. makes classes fun every time and is very witty and funny. shows a lot of videos in class and calls on people so you never have to actively participate, just say something at all and he'll give you participation credit. i also learned more in this class than any other.", 
            "Look, in high school, spanish was my worst class, and one of my least favorites. Jose changed this for me. He is funny and endearing, and on top of that, I learned more spanish from him than in my prior 5 years of spanish. He doesn't assign as much homework as the other teachers for the course. TAKE THIS COURSE WITH HIM.", 
            "The guy to get for 232. What a character. However, grading is pretty strict, but that's to be expected from all the instructors. Class was actually pretty fun considering no one wanted to be there.", 
            "Jose is awesome, very enthusiastic, hilarious, helpful, and above all else, a great teacher.", 
            "Jose knows that most students take this class out of requirement and thus tries to make it as interesting as possible. Lots of enthusiasm, enjoyable environment, as well as a very good teacher. Definite recommendation.", 
            "Absolutely love Jose. He is hilarious and nice, but also make the class interesting and is really informative. If you need to take 232 DEFINITELY take it with Jose!", 
            "Jose is amazing for Spanish 232. The class is very relaxed, so students feel comfortable asking questions and making mistakes. Jose jokes around a lot while still managing to effectively teach the material. I loved this class and would highly recommend him!", 
            "Jose' is the best Spanish teacher to have for 232! He is very laid back and therefore, creates a relaxed classroom environment. He is not too tough of a grader and understands this class is a requirement for LSA students. He is very friendly and quirky and gets to know everyone. He is also always up-beat and i highly recommend you take his classes.",

I looked foward to going to class because he made it funa and interesting. Theres a ton of work but exams were easy and I really enjoyed the class, especially with him as the teacher."

He analyces development topics very well and tries to give atudents a profound understanding of todays struggles and how they relate to past events. He likes to make his students think. However, he doesnt have the best teaching skills and usually repeats the same information many times.", 
            "This class is absolutely horrible. Prof Owusu is obviously smart but has no idea how to teach. We watch videos that are nearly twice my age. Half the class is athletes that have full-volume convos in the back, and he says nothing. His notes are a mess, he interrupts students when they answer his questions... I could go on. Horrendous course.", 
            "Professor Owusu is clearly a kind guy & well-qualified, as he has an impressive past. But his class is incredibly boring and outdated. The combo of his Ghanian accent and general old age make him hard to follow. Readings are rambling, uninteresting % dated. He gives 2 essays and doesn't grade too harshly so it's a pretty easy A but not worth it.", 
            "Professor Owusu has been an outstanding educator in the department of Cultural Anthropology for many years. He is very influential to the field. The graduate department is top in the nation. I highly recommend taking the opportunity to take a course with Dr. Owusu.", 
            "boring and not easily understandable, material is all over the place", 
            "Owusu's a wonderful, intelligent guy, but this class is straight up awful. I took it as a freshman & I completely hated the experience. His lectures are long & rambling, his assignments are unclear, & every material we use-including the $72.00 coursepack-is entirely outdated. Also, he takes attendance, so you have to skip wisely. Don't take it man.", 
            "Easiest class ever. Three essays and that is it. Do not read, do not take notes, do not get stressed. Just go to class sign in and wait for him to hand in the essay requirements. He will tell you exactly where you will find the info in the course pack. Do not try to analyze just write exactly what the author is saying. Easy A", 
            "I absolutely adore him as a person, and when talking to him outside of class he fascinates me. However, he isn't a great teacher. I was fine with the classroom atmosphere, but I think most students would hate it. The only thing that kept me awake was how interesting he was. I didn't learn much of anything. Everything we used was entirely outdated.", 
            "Friendly, intelligent prof. Extremely boring lectures. Extensive reading. Unclear Syllabus. Doesn't use any technology (email/CTools/powerpoint). Illegible handwriting. Hard accent to understand. Grade pretty much depends on paper scores. I don't recommend taking this class - I dread going to the two 90min discussions every week.", 
            "He's brilliant but the class is dull beyond belief. It's really unfortunate that he just can't engage the class, and sometimes I actually feel bad for him standing up there writing nonsense all over the board while we sit back and try to figure out what the hell he's rambling about. It can get uncomfortable.", 
            "I love this class. He's a goofy guy who is obviously very smart and has a lot of insight into what he is teaching. There's no email, ctools, and we watch VHS tapes all the time. He clearly explains exactly what to write in the papers which is great. Planning on taking another course he teaches next semester. Just attend class and you'll do fine.", 
            "A very nice guy, and observably brilliant, but he just cannot teach. His lectures are incomprehensible and boring, and the paper assignments are unclear. It's fairly easy as a course, but if you want to learn anything for the long term, pick something else.", 
            "I've taken 411, 414, 439 with him-awful teacher so don't expect to learn ANYTHING but they were the easiest As I've gotten. Go to class, sign in, leave. Don't ever do the readings-just use them for papers, which are 8 questions that specify where in the readings the answers are. EASY class if you don't take it seriously, FRUSTRATING if you do.", 
            "I'm in the class now. 25% of class is texting. He has written kinship on the board 15 times. I can't read his hand writing. it doesn't really matter because how many times can he explain the same thing. He is brilliant but why is he writing nouns like love on the board as if we are in 3rd grade. I am bored, not learning but it fills the requirement", 
            "Class is horrible. Worst class at UM. Was super excited to learn about the course material only to come to class to watch 1970's dateline videos about crime in the US. WHAT?! not what i signed up for. he spends all hour writing the word \"society\" on the chalk board. doesn't know what an email or ctools is either..",

All of the readings and videos are at least 15 years out of date and there is no Ctools. He doesn't even have an email account. The syllabus makes it seem like a blow-off class but it isn't.", 
            "Took 333 and 439. He knows a lot and is extremely friendly, helpful, and detailed. The papers are easy if you go to class, and if you read any of the material at all you can participate without hesitation. Combines abstract concepts with modern day life and is a great professor.",

She forwarded it to the dean who got involved and obviously took her side. No one respected him afterwards", 
            "It's been three years since I took this class and I still get angry thinking of him. He doesn't care about his students, and he once went out of his way to make my life torture and made me sit in a room for 8 hours because I had extra time because I broke my arm just in case I would tell anyone in the class what was on the final. Who does that", 
            "This class is based solely on his GSI's grading ability. Basically if you get a bad GSI you're screwed since there is NO standardization. My GSI (not to mention names) gave long and difficult quizzes whereas the other GSI gave T/F quizzes with easy answers. I easily put in more work than other kids in the class but the GSI I had ruined my grade.", 
            "Professor Morrow is a really smart guy whose lectures were generally interesting. Everything was incredibly straight forward. Exam short answer questions were nearly word-for-word taken from the review questions at the end of each book chapter. Speaking of the book, it's rather dry, as long as you show up to lecture you don't need to read anyways.", 
            "Professor Morrow is an interesting professor and his lectures are always intriguing. He is heavy on the lectures but you won't have to do much reading (the book is one he wrote and it isn't published so it's pretty dry). He's funny and keeps things straight forward.", 
            "Okay, so I honestly enjoyed the class. The concepts are interesting. The book is kind of dry and there are huge blocks of text (ironic since the GSIs seem to hate that). I personally didn't have too many grievances about grading but it IS based on your GSI's preferences. If you read and attend class you should be fine.", 
            "The class is fairly mundane and boring. The worst part about this is the GSI's and their grading system. 40% of your grade is based on two papers that they grade, which no one will receive above a B on. I love politics, did't like this class. Stay Away.", 
            "I loved Morrow. He is an absolute savage. He makes his lectures entertaining. I really loved his teaching style. The textbook is helpful because the short answers on the test come directly from the review questions. My biggest complaint about the class is the GSIs. Morrow does not communicate with them and the grading criteria is unclear for papers", 
            "This guy basically wrote the textbook we \"use\" for the course, so he definitely knows his stuff. You're technically supposed to read the textbook, but you don't have to because Morrow gives you the most important points from every lecture at the end. The presentations are all on Canvas as well so lecture isn't mandatory. GSI was nice but not great.", 
            "The professor himself is fine... content of the lectures on the other hand? Not so much. The grading is very specific, but only to GSIs, which would be great if you could get a GSI that actually speaks English and releases exam scores.", 
            "Professor Morrow is truly an inspiring professor. He's absolutely hilarious and his lectures truly allow you to gain an understanding of the material. He uses the active learning platform on canvas to keep you engaged during lecture and records all his lectures, which are great for review I'd recommend POLSCI 160 to anyone!",

            "Morrow is a well-respected scholar in his field, and his lectures are at the same level. Stay away from this class at all costs... Your GSI determines 95% of your grade and subjectivity between GSI's is ridiculous. Worst class decision of my college career and also worst grade...", 
            "Professor Morrow is a passionate and humorous lecturer; he's also very knowledgeable in world politics. Attendance is not mandantory and slides are posted on active learning program. Reading textbook and listening to lecture help to understand the material more deeply. Tests are the review questions in textbook and writing essay applying the theory", 
            "I found Morrow's lectures interesting and he tries to engage with the class. Tbh better to go to/watch the recordings of the lectures than read the textbook (he wrote it, but it's a draft) which is kinda boring and has no pictures. My GSI wasn't great but I found the class easy and straightforward; if you do your work you'll be fine.", 
            "Morrow is a good if you are okay with a \"drier\" lecturer. Your grade is going to depend mainly on your GSI (the papers and discussion participation are about half your grade), and the exams are far from easy. You have to work for this one, but interesting topics are covered.", 
            "Decent lecturer, very straightforward and gives clear expectations and guidelines, you can tell he knows what he's talking about. Do the reading or go to lecture, but you don't have to do both because they're the exact same material.", 
            "He kept the lectures very interesting and you always know what to expect on the exams and papers. The textbook is kinda annoying at times but overall a very good experience", 
            "He's an incredibly dry lecturer. I came in interested in the material, and I left the class feeling bitter. I would suggest taking any other intro political science class."

            "Prof. Hass is incredibly knowledgeable on U.S. Wars and Conflicts and the memory of those situations, not to mention her status as a well-established member of the historical research community. She was very open to have in-depth conversations and connected with the class very well. Highly recommend her smaller lectures.", 
            "Lecture helps clarify power points, which are posted online. DEFINITELY go to lecture when exam questions are handed out. She gives you all the possible questions, tells you the format, and gives hints. To prepare for exams, write out practice essays and memorize them. You don't need to do that readings, if you do that (can skim to find support).", 
            "I was shocked at how much I learned in this class. Lectures are posted online before class, but go to lecture because they are bare minimum. Talks fast, type notes onto slides. Office hours are great, she will tell you what exactly to do. Go to class when exam Qs/paper prompts are handed out- gives lots of hints.", 
            "Professor Hass seems like a really nice person, however one cannot solely teach on that quality. Her lectures are all over the place and the amount of reading is completely unnecessary. She teaches a very leftist perspective of american culture. As long as you regurgitate her opinions, you'll get an A.", 
            "To be honest, it makes me sad Prof Hass got this low of a rating. She knows soo much about American Culture and History, and yes, she does assign alot of reading which alot of the time is not necessary to complete, and her lectures are sometimes scattered, but I genuinely like her as a teacher. Don't take this class if you bore easily.", 
            "Poorly organized class and unstructured lecture style. Large amt of reading. Hass' views are very leftist, but that wasn't the problem. She just does not \"tie the pieces together\" with the scattered thoughts of her lectures. Can also come off full of herself. Assignments also abstract and unclear, which affects grading. Would NOT recommend!!", 
            "AWFUL teacher. Get your race/ethnicity somewhere else. Her reading assignments are incredibly long and boring. Her writing assignments are vague and her grading scale is terrible (\"An A paper should have gone above and beyond\"). Avoid at all costs.", 
            "The worst class I have EVER taken. She is SO unclear as to what she wants in the assignments. The amount of reading is unreal. There is 200 pages of reading a week. The midterm was 50 minutes long and we had to write 10 short answers and write 2 full essays-way too much work for intro level class. I hate this class."

            "Dunlap is one of the best professors I've had at the University. It's not an easy A, but everything you need to know is in the lecture slides. I originally was not a fan of microbiology, but he's so passionate about it that he really made me like it. He's also pretty funny at times and has fair grading criteria.", 
            "The past reviews make it a point to explain how hard the tests were. Well what did you expect? This is college. Microbiology is a complex field that requires a lot of prior knowledge. You're really lucky, because Dr. Dunlap is such a great teacher that really presents material in an interesting way. It also helps that he's like a charming grandpa.", 
            "Dunlap is actually really funny but his exams are SO specific, like if you do not know every word on every powerpoint slide you will not do well on exams. Also DO NOT buy the book OR the lab manual. Fun fact: try to find someone who took the class with him and ask for their exams because about 50% of exam 1 and 2 were identical from the year prior", 
            "Professor Dunlap is very dedicated to teaching his students Microbiology. However, his exams are extremely difficult and he gives zero leeway on grading. His lectures are okay, but insanely fast, so make sure to reread every slide. His exams come straight from the slides-which sounds easy-but the questions are extremely specific.", 
            "Dr. Dunlap changed my view on microbiology and actually now am pursuing a microbiology major. He makes his lecture engaging and interesting to listen to and is very funny. Grades are determined from 4 exams of which one of them you can drop and then lab. Take the class seriously, attend and pay attention in lecture, and you'll get a good grade.", 
            "I love Paul's personality and cute grandpa vibes. I've became more aware of the microbial world around & definitely recommend taking his class. However, his grading is strict so it's definitely not an easy A. E1 and 3 are hard but 2 and 4 were easier. It's straight scaled and lab quizzes are hard & written by Ammerlaan. 28 hrs to study/ exam for A.", 
            "Dunlap is definitely a gem. His unique personality and funny comments make lecture fun and interesting! However, Bio 207 is not easy, as his exams are pretty much a regurgitation of the minute details of his slides. It's not impossible as long as you give it a lot of time. Lab is pretty fun, but make sure to take the practical exams seriously.", 
            "He is a very unique individual, but he really loves his subject and it comes through. He is very old school, and the only way you can get his lectures slides is if you go to class, but he is also very passionate about being fair. He will test you on every single fact from the slides, but that's it. He'll never pull obscure questions from the book.", 
            "Dr. Dunlap did a great job of explaining the various topics. He made sure we knew what to understand in grave detail, and when going back to study it was nice to refer to the textbook for figures and further explanation. The lecture and lab were fun and not too difficult. All material needed for the exams were on the slides given.", 
            "I really liked this class. Dunlap is quirky, but hilarious! I thought he did a great job explaining the concepts and emphasizing what things were most important. The exams ranged all over the place in terms of difficulty (1 and 3 were hard, 2 and 4 were easy). The tests come straight from the notes, but are EXTREMELY specific. Also, lab was awesome", 
            "I loved Dunlap! I didn't have much interest coming into the Intro to Microbio, but he was so passionate and knowledgable (and funny) about the subject that I got really into the class. His exams are not easy and will test you over the smallest details of slides, but overall I would recommend this class. The lab section is easy and fun!", 
            "Dunlap is one of my favorite professors I've ever had! Coming into the class, I had no interest in microbio, but he made the class really enjoyable! He's very quirky and funny. His lecture notes are a bit overwhelming (huge paragraphs on the slides) but they cover every thing you need to know for the exams.", 
            "Terrible professor. Extremely old school. No resources provided except slides at lecture, which were also terrible. No formatting what so ever, with terrible grammar making easy concepts difficult. Somehow made anything interesting a complete bore.", 
            "He's not as great as people say he is; I personally did not like him. His exams are full of miniscule information, information that is found in the fine print of his lecture slides. What I thought that was very unprofessional was that a GSI brought their child into Exam 3. She was laughing and talking, which I found to be very distracting.", 
            "Dunlap is one of the worst BIO professors I have had at U of M. His lectures are boring, and provides irreverent information. One slide will contain 1-2 paragraphs of information. Tests are ok, but for the information he wants you to know a 50 question test is kind of ridiculous. He takes minimal effort to promote learning of microbio. Boo.", 
            "Dunlap is hilarious. He is a strange man, but it keeps the lectures interesting. You have to go to lecture to get the handouts of his slides. The exams are in class, which is nice, but you have to literally memorize his lectures in order to do well. He knows what he is talking about and the material is not conceptually hard. Lab is awesome too", 
            "Dunlap is a GREAT teacher, very friendly, & passionate about his class. Very helpful in office hours, too. The class material itself is not too complicated, but nearly everything needs to be memorized for exams. 1,000x better than Ammerlaan, in my opinion! However, the lab (M.C.Ammer-coordinated) is phenomenal! Very interesting & pretty chill.", 
            "I had Dunlap for intro to micro in Fall 09. He's a hilarious professor and super nice. If you ever get a chance to go to his office hours, he's a really friendly and easy person to talk to about anything. As others have said, go to lecture, and get his handouts, then you can walk out. That's pretty much all you need.", 
            "Dunlap is a very unique guy with strange humor, but he is very passionate about what he teaches and does a good job in conveying the material to students. The issue I had (and I think others as well) was that exams required memorizing EVERY little detail on the slides, no exceptions. Not sure how he rationalized his grading scale, either.", 
            "This class is not so easy anymore. You will be required to memorize approximately 130-150 powerpoint slides every 2.5 weeks for exams. Exams are primarily essay. No study guides or sample essay questions are given prior to the exam. If you can memorize all the information, you can get and A. Every minute detail is game. Save time to study."

            "FAVORITE CLASS EVER! lectures were not not mandatory and when i attended it, it was with the intention to read the book but i always ended up paying attention. He shows very interesting videos and excerpts from real life that are very relevant. As long as you read the book and put in some effort, you can get an A.",

            "One of the best classes I've taken here. Lecture is boring, and pointless as long as you read the textbook, which actually isn't boring. Exams are easy and discussion is 2 hours but the material is interesting and you mostly just watch videos.", 
            "Amazing class, great lecturer, incorporates humor, enjoyable to listen to, and a nice guy all around. The class was super interesting and there was not one topic I did not enjoy listening to! I took this class as a second semester junior and it is BY FAR the best psychology class I have taken here.",

            "Lecture was quite interesting, but relatively unrelated to class grade/ exams. Tests come straight from the book, which is an interesting read, for the most part. Tests questions are really obscure, but there is a lot of opportunity to get points on assignments.", 
            "Such a fun class. I loved that we covered such a wide range of disorders and extra credit is always helpful. But I think my gsi made the assignments more confusing than they really were.", 
            "I really enjoyed Prof Hansell's lectures. I think that they could have prepared us a little better for the exams though, but I am really glad he allowed us to do extra credit, pushed me from an A- to an A.", 
            "Very easy interesting class. I found lecture useless though so I stopped going about halfway through the semester. Definitely would recommend if you are interested in Psychology or just want an easy A.", 
            "Very nice and enthusiastic teacher. He makes an interesting topic even more interesting. I recommend this class, just keep in mind a big part of your grade is from discussion section (so do your work).",

I would love to track him down to take another of his classes-- hands down my favorite professor at Michigan, and I've been here for 4 years. I recommend this class even for non-psych people.

            "If you attend ICPSR's Summer Program without taking Franzese's course, you are missing a truly inspirational experience. He was one of the most talked about profs because of how easily he make's stats funny and fascinating, which is no small feat. His course is the best and most rewarding available at ICPSR. If you're serious about stats, take it.",

Awesome professor, awesome course, awesome experience!",

Also, he is a generous educator, willing to help out outside of class when the material is unclear. Highly recommended!",

The GSIs for his courses (I've taken another course with him) have to basically re-teach everything for the students. His lectures are incomprehensible and confusing, and I have yet to learn much from them.",

She will let you know if you're doing well just as she will let you know if you're messing up--so be careful. All in all, she's a great prof who takes pride in her work and grades accordingly.", 
            "Her lectures are fun and animated - even through dry grammar points. Questions are encouraged. She makes a point to remember every student's name and tries to accommodate all learning styles. Office hours seem may seem scary at first, but they're very relaxed and helpful for your specific problems+good practice for proficiency- Highly recommended!", 
            "Not an easy A by any means, but Dominique is one of the greatest educators I've ever encountered. She made having conversations with a native speakers comfortable, she's funny and so incredibly helpful. I would take a class with her every semester for the rest of college if I could.",

She's 100% gold",

There is a coursepack and textbook, both of which are confusing in themselves, but you also have to keep skipping between the two to find what you need. The exercises in the coursepack are usually way above the student's level. But you'll manage. :(",

            "Lee was the course coordinator when I took orgo2. For some reason, she did not discuss material with the other lecturers which resulted in profs covering different things, leaving many students unprepared for her exams. The avg on one of our exams was in the 40%'s. I realize orgo is hard, but I think an average that low reflects poorly on her", 
            "What is everyone's issue? Here's an idea, instead of going out every weekend to get trashed, maybe stay in and study a little bit! Dr. Lee did go a bit fast, but I managed to understand her AND draw all the structures/mechanisms WITHOUT her notes. Sounds like people are taking out their frustration with the course on Dr. Lee...which is just stupid.", 
            "I got an A in the class too. Yes, you have to put in many hours but that doesn't mean she is a good teacher. She goes way too fast. A bit rude and full of herself out of class. Doesn't respond to emails. The tests are all reagant based so practice a lot! Overall not a good teacher imo, you've been warned. The rest is up to you.", 
            "This is the Pre-Med Weed-Out class. Lee is an excellent teacher, the class is just very difficult and exams can be impossible at times. This doesnt make her a bad teacher, shes brilliant, the class is curved to a B- for a reason. Your grade in this class is 100% your work. She gives everyone the same chance, just own the kid next to you.", 
            "Don't listen to all the bitter students, Dr. Lee is a very good professor. She is very helpful and explains the material clearly. The handouts keeps things very neat and organized. Orgo 2 is semi-difficult, but put in the hours learning it and you'll be fine. I got an A and I would definitely recommend her above Kiste and Phillips.", 
            "I didn't attend her lectures (would have but had to go to phillips because of a calc 2 conflict). I understand though, that she is the writer of the exams which are rediculous. The first three are doable but the final consisted of 4/6 pages synthesis and the mechanisms were always things that were 'similar' to what we had actually learned.", 
            "Lee isn't bad. Orgo 2 is hard, period. She does go really, really fast, but if you print out her sheets then there is more than enough time to copy everything down and listen to her.", 
            "I didn't think Dr. Lee was that bad. I was signed up for Dr. Phillips' class and went to hers instead because Dr. Phillips is way worse. She always answered my emails quickly and clearly. The class is a **** but Dr. Lee isn't a bad teacher.", 
            "Do not listen to some people on here. I got an A in orgo 1 and borderline for the A in orgo2. She is terrible, down right terrible. Extremely inconsistent. Doesnt care about students. Take it another term w/o her I would advice anyone. self studied this entire term pretty much and went to 2 lectures every day so I wouldnt miss anything. Way to fast", 
            "Dr. Lee is terrible about replying to student's emails on questions regarding the course material. She goes extremely fast in lecture, you must print out all of her lecture sheets just to keep up with her speediness.", 
            "Lori Lee is a joke of a professor and what's worse is that it doesn't even matter who you have for lecture because she's the only one that writes the tests. She is a terrible teacher! Goes way too fast and doesn't care if you understand anything. Take Orgo at another school over the summer!", 
            "i would never recommend this professor to anyone ever in my life. she doesnt care if anyone understood the material or not, she keeps on going, shes wayy too fast , sometimes i had hard time to cope up with copying mechanism to my notebook and listening to her", 
            "Not very useful, only replied once to my emails, when I asked for an alternate exam. I never went to lecture, I just used Dr. Koreeda's notes and brushed over the things that were unique to her notes. I personally thought the final was very straightforward with no tricks at all. She isn't tricky, she just tests every minor detail. Like a good prof.", 
            "One word - disappointment! If you want to take chemistry classes and actually enjoy and understand them, take them with Nolta and Koreeda whenever possible. Pretty much everyone else is a poor excuse for chem professors and she is no exception. And don't even get me started on that final exam. lol.", 
            "She will ignore your emails any time she doesn't feel like responding. Her lectures are often impossible to follow - you just have to frantically copy every detail she writes down. You will only get to see the big picture on actual exams. And her final was RIDICULOUS! Lecturers like this are a shame for the UofM! Where is my $40000/year going?!", 
            "She always seemed very willing to meet outside of class and help out when it was needed, but overall I was disappointed. As other people have said, the final was impossibly hard, heavily covering material that had been mentioned once, if ever in lecture. In an uncurved class, having an average of 51% for 40% of the grade is never a good thing.", 
            "If you miss a day of lecture, it's probably OK because she always goes over the same mechanisms several times. I wished that she would have explained why things happened instead of just repeating over and over that they did. Exams were OK, but final exam was disrespectfully difficult--average was 51%.", 
            "I enjoyed CHEM 215 with Dr. Lee very much. While she does go a bit fast at times in lecture, the notes she gives are very concise and useful. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOING TO OPEN DISCUSSION. It definitely helped me with the harder exam problems, especially the syntheses. The final was VERY DIFFICULT! Be ready for all the hardest types of problems", 
            "Extremely unhelpful because she's never available and have also has failed to respond to emails. Doesn't teach things properly during lecture. You should probably go to open discussion.", 
            "Dr. Lee is an excellent teacher. People complained she sometimes went to fast in lectures, but she makes clearly organized outlines of what is important. Open discussions are SO helpful as well. She gives a lot of tips for doing well on the exams. Exams are difficult, but definitely fair. Would definitely recommend taking orgo with her."

She's got a couple rules that you need to follow like not using your phone in class and speaking only in Spanish. If you do that, you'll be in good shape. She's the only choice for this class.", 
            "Truly an amazing professor. I had her my second semester freshman year and her class completely changed my opinion of the university. She's not an easy grader, but if you go to her office hours she's completely willing to help you succeed. Highly recommend any class taught by her.", 
            "Carla is a really good teacher. She helps students when they have questions. Make sure to speak in Spanish when talking to her and other students as she does watch and listen for participation. She is really sweet and wants her students to succeed so don't be afraid to ask for help. She is not the easiest grader on papers. Still recommend 10/10 :)", 
            "Carla is very nice. She is a tough grader, but I learned a lot of Spanish. She does have a way of actually making class fun from time to time, and she is very easy going.", 
            "My favorite Spanish teacher by far. I actually love coming to class because of her. She is really nice and helpful. Her grading is not super easy, but more lenient than other Spanish teachers at this school. Highly recommend taking it with her.", 
            "Carla is absolutely one of the best teachers in the department. She so funny and bubbly and our class dynamic was absolutely amazing. I used to dread going to spanish, but with her, I looked forward to class every day.", 
            "Carla is an amazing teacher and a really cool person in general. This class is a decent amount of work, but the theme of this course (Espa\u00f1a en contraste) is awesome. Expect a decent amount of studyingwork but a really rewarding class experience!", 
            "Carla is cooperative, caring, and somewhat engaging. She makes this difficult class relatively manageable. Looking through the profs ctools sites, I found that she offers 3 times the study material. If you use the materials that she gives you and put forth an honest effort you'll do muy bien.", 
            "Best spanish teacher I've ever had! She is so nice and really gets to know her students.", 
            "She is a very lovely teacher and really knows about the subject that she is teaching. She is always willing to help. The tests are hard but overall the class is a good one.", 
            "This is my fourth semester of Spanish, and Carla is by far the best teacher I've had. She's hilarious, very easy to understand, and willing to help if something is unclear. Plus, she starts every class with a music video. If you have the choice, take her themed class, it's actually pretty interesting.", 
            "Carla is a great professor. The content can be difficult to grasp but she is always willing to spend time helping you understand. She even gives information about study abroad programs to help her students travel!", 
            "Carla is a great professor. You won't waste time in class, however you will do many many exercises and readings. Some of the material is difficult to grasp and isn't supplemented well by the book or worksheets. Carla does a wonderful job covering what our text doesn't. And she rightly deserves her chili pepper award.", 
            "Carla's exercises are great and get you reading, listening and speaking. She is very kind and will help any student that needs help in office hours. Also has info on study abroad. She knows the material inside and out and happily answers any questions. Exams can be a little bit difficult but do the practice she puts online. HW everyday counts!", 
            "Love this woman. Best Spanish teacher I've had at Michigan.", 
            "Carla is a fantastic Spanish teacher. I had a very bad experience with 231 and I was thrilled when I got to 232. Carla is fun and helpful, she made the class interesting and easy to understand. She is very knowledgable and is a fair grader. I would recommend this class to anyone.", 
            "Carla is fantastic. I used to hate spanish before this class, but she made it fun and enjoyable for everyone. When I got sick i the beginning of the semester, she worked with me to get me back on track and was very helpful in office hours. Take her themed class, and work hard and participate, and you will do well.", 
            "Carla is the worst professor I have ever had, she was very unhelpful during office hours and was very rude in an e-mail to me. She told me that she realized that I was a hard worker and that my work ethic would pay off in other classes. I have never met anyone who cares less about the success of her students.", 
            "Carla is amazing. I went into Spanish 232 after two and a half years of not taking/speaking Spanish. I was so scared to start Spanish again but Carla made the class so much fun and it turned out to be my favorite class that semester! She is passionate, dedicated, understanding, and fun. Take Spanish with her if you get the chance!", 
            "Carla is awesome! She has the cutest clothes and she is so nice. She is funny and a great teacher. She makes the class fun and interesting. She is hands down my favorite teacher so far at U-M!!"

            "Wayne is an angel. Gives you iClicker answers and is hilarious and cute. Didn't learn a lot from the class but as long as you take a bunch of practice exams (2013 or later) you'll be fine. There's a ton of extra credit on mastering physics where you can make up for lost points. I wouldn't take this class with the other prof if possible.", 
            "Hilarious man, basically tells you all the answers to iclicker questions. If you copy old practice exam questions on your notecard for exams it's super easy and I didn't really learn anything in this class but I had fun.", 
            "Wayne Lau may be the greatest man to ever live. He is so passionate about physics, and makes it so interesting with a lot of different experiments. His exams are super easy and as long as you do the practice exams beforehand you'll do well.", 
            "Dr. Lau was fantastic for Physics 135. He explained things very well, and always worked hard to ensure that everyone understood the topics. Additionally, he had availability in the physics help room for additional assistance outside of class, and was a very kind individual overall.", 
            "Dr. Lau is a really great professor and he made physics bearable. He's super funny and easygoing, and he gives you the answers to most of the iclickers. As long as you put in the work doing the practice exams- you'll be fine and do great in the class!", 
            "Dr. Lau is the BEST! Do not take Physics 135 unless it's with him. His tests are straight from the practice exams, he makes in class demos fun and interesting, and he essentially gives you the answers to 99% of the iclicker questions. He's also an incredibly kind man and will go above and beyond if you need assistance.", 
            "Lau really cares about his students. It's really easy to pass if you do the homework (there's a lot) and show up, but you don't really learn much.", 
            "Wayne is probably the funniest professor I have had throughout my time as an undergrad. He really wants every student to succeed and makes lectures interesting.", 
            "Wayne's really chill, but he doesn't teach at all. You'll have to teach yourself physics if you take the 135/235 series. They try to take all the math out of physics, which makes it a lot more conceptual. I don't like the style, but it's pretty easy to get an A in this class.", 
            "Dr. Lau tries to give it his all, but the class is just poorly structured (not a quality unique to classes taught by Lau). He leaves the i-Clicker open which allows you to change your answer if you are indeed wrong. Didn't read the book, didn't go over the slides. Just went through the practice exams, and took every question off of 6 practice exams", 
            "Wayne Lau is the sweetest professor I've met. His demos are hilarious too. The class is easier than I anticipated because we get to drop an exam and 6 lectures/iClickers, we're allowed to bring notecards to the exams (which are exactly like the past exams), and there's extra credit for the online homework. I wish I could take him for 235!", 
            "Wayne is such a nice guy and genuinely wants everyone to do well. He makes lecture very entertaining and enjoyable and explains concepts pretty well.", 
            "Going to lecture is pointless but mandatory because of iclicker. Wayne is a cool guy but you honestly dont need to pay attention to lecture at all to do well as long as you do the practice exams because they are the same as the exams.", 
            "He was such a nice professor and genuinely wanted the students to do well. He realized that science classes are not easy and did his best to help us. An incredible and extremely funny professor- one of my favorites!", 
            "Wayne is awesome and by far better than any of the 235 professors. If you have to take physics, take 135 with Wayne! He is super nice and makes lecture very entertaining and funny. The exams are just problems from previous exams and you get to drop your lowest one, so you may be able to get away with not taking the final.", 
            "He is such a great guy. His lectures are kind of confusing but he makes up for it by being the best professor. He cares about his students and wants everyone to do well. Definitely recommend taking physics with him!", 
            "Prof. Lau may not be the best professor in the world, but teaches the material well enough for every student to succeed. He knows most students in the class are pre-med and makes the class very easy to get an A, he gives you the iClicker answers and drops your lowest exam. Overall, he's a really cool guy who wants all of his students to do well.", 
            "Dr. Lau was one of my favorite professors at the university of michigan. His lectures were always fun, and he is hilarious. His exams are also quite fair, as long as you do the practice exams before each test. A great guy!", 
            "The exams are quite easy so long as you study past exams (he reuses a lot of questions). I taught myself most of the material right before the exams and just went to class for the iClicker points. He's helpful if you ask him questions outside of class; he really wants everyone to do well in the class! One exam is dropped."

            "I've only met Dr. Poniatowski once a week for lectures on upcoming experiments. Despite rarely meeting him, I like the fact that he's approachable after lectures to ask questions. Besides, the exam review he held before the midterm was really helpful. The only thing I wish he could improve is using slides for lectures alongside writing on the board", 
            "Attending Dr. Poniatowski's lectures can help you with post lab manuscripts and worksheets, but attendance is optional and honestly it's not worth the time. Labs aren't very hard but the the out of class work is time consuming. Midterm exam and lab practical are really easy. Basically it's an easy A if you get a good GSI and put in the work.", 
            "He's purely a lecturer. However, he is hilarious even though it involves chemistry. Personally, I despise chemistry, but he jokes non stop. He also climbs up to write on the triple decker board in the lecture hall. The topics he teaches can be hard, but he does well teaching it.", 
            "Dr. Poniatowski was incredibly understanding and one of the kindest professors I've ever had. Lectures are not mandatory, but he is more than available to answer questions and work with you individually about course concerns. If you haven't had a lab course, this class will be challenging, but it is not a reflection of the professor. He's great.", 
            "Taking 215 with Poniatowski after having Nolta for 210 was a little bit of culture shock. He really makes you work on your own, which is fine I guess since it is college.", 
            "I've never seen a instructor who's five minutes late for almost all the lectures and office hours, making the concepts more confusing, and not willing to help students. Orgo isn't easy. If you want to learn something from the lectures instead of googling everything and learning it all by yourself at home, then don't take it with him!",

            "It is clear that Poniatowski knows a great deal about this subject, but often seems to forget that none of us have a degree in chemistry and rarely spends time explaining concepts. He also has random temper tantrums that are very distracting and condescending. He never cleans the chalkboards properly which is super annoying.", 
            "He does not explain the subjects clear. His voice is so boring and he becomes angry easily. Don't take this class with him.", 
            "I learned a lot from his class and enjoyed the challenge- he taught the material in a way where we actually learned the concepts instead of just memorizing rules and formulas. He's very into what he does but doesn't put up with trouble from anyone, so try to avoid messing around in lecture. I found him to be one of the best instructors so far.", 
            "Poniatowski can be kinda rude. People say he is a decent teacher because he gets bare minimum done for the job but you still get an ok grade.", 
            "Didn't have much contact with Poniatowski since I had him for Orgo 2 lab lecture. He was pretty funny and clearly explained important concepts, as well as grading criteria. Something I really liked was that he feels the need to do a lot of practice problems to help explain concepts - made it much easier to study for the tests.", 
            "I have had Poniatowski for two lab classes and both times have thought he was hilarious and passionate about chemistry. He is very fair when it comes to expectations: for example, he knew that no one wanted to do iClickers and so he changed the grading system.", 
            "While his attending lectures isn't actually that necessary for completing the labs, you still don't want to miss the opportunity to hear him speak. He seems exceptionally kind and caring, and he makes learning the lab procedures way more interesting than it probably is. Also, it's always entertaining to see him climb up the chalk board ;)", 
            "Lectures are very interesting and helpful to understand the material. Lab accompanying course is AWFUL - lots of work outside lab, insufficient materials, disorganized GSIs. The lab practical final was killer, and most of the labs just don't make sense.", 
            "Poniatowski was a great guy who was an awesome lecturer even though the lab that accompanied his lecture was a completely pointless nightmare. He's the type of guy that you want to be bros with.", 
            "I thoroughly enjoyed professor Poniatowski's lectures. He was always funny, and made chemistry very understandable, even for someone who might not be as advanced in the subject.", 
            "Dr. Poniatowski is really funny and makes the chem lab concepts easy to understand. Go to lecture, do the prelabs, and read through the procedures prior to lab and you will do fine. Midterm was more challenging than expected, and the lab practical was brutal, but your grade is curved against your section so just put a lot of effort into lab reports", 
            "This professor's lectures are centered around the lab that you are about to do. He basically tells you exactly what you need to do in the lab and what you need to cover in your lab report. The class is super hard and unpleasant, grading is really tough, but this professor isn't in charge of that, your GSI is. This professor makes it bearable."

Not only is she extremely knowledgeable of the material and concepts, but she is a down-to-earth, caring, and helpful person. She does everything to help and encourage her students to succeed. Both courses were made soo much easier because of her approach to teaching.", 
            "Jill is hands down the best teacher at UofM! She puts my other professors to shame!She is extremely helpful and genuinely cares about the success of her students! She assigns a good amount of HW but only b/c she knows practice make perfect! I highly recommend her (both math 115 and 116).I LOVE HER and wish she taught UL Math!", 
            "Jill cares about her students but is sometimes unclear. She doesn't spend much time going over topics in class and will only give a few examples and then give extensive quizzes that in my opinion are much harder than the actual exams. She is willing to help though and makes learning the subject a lot easier. Expect a lot of outside homework.", 
            "This is hands down the best teacher I've had at U of M so far. She's an extremely helpful professor and she explains the material well. The class is a lot of work so I wouldn't suggest taking this class if you have several other difficult classes at the same time. However, the workload actually helps prepare you for the exams.", 
            "Jill is an awesome instructor! She loves math and her students, so, as long as you're willing to put in the work, you will understand and do well. Don't let her oddball appearance deter you. Everyone loves Jill!", 
            "Jill is the best teacher ever. Take her class. You will learn so much and the material will make a lot of sense", 
            "I went to jill for tutoring and i have to say she is the smartest woman on this planet. A double major from MIT in english and mathematics, she will tutor from pre-algrebra, calc 1-4, and higher, contact her if you ever need a tutor, she is the best there is", 
            "Jill is the best. I had her for a whole yr (calc 1&2)and i dont think i cared about my education or my grade more than she did. She went way and beyond to help me, at times I almost didn't want her to help me anymore. But I'm glad she didn't stop. I dont think there will be another teacher who is so fun, exciting, helpful, and passionate like her.", 
            "I've taken AP Calc before, and hearing Jill explain things made them even that much clearer! CSP is a great program and Jill really knows what she is talking about!", 
            "Sweet prof!", 
            "If every teacher were like Jill, I would have gotten my money's worth out of college!! Going into my final semester of college and still haven't had a teacher half as good as Jill!!!", 
            "Jill is the best teacher that I have ever had! I have never seen a teacher who puts as much effort into her students or has as much passion for what she does than Jill. She is really fun and funny and just lovable!", 
            "She will go above and beyond to help her students. It is very stange to see an instructor be as helpful as Jill is.", 
            "Jill is a GENIUS! literally. She is the most helpful teacher I've ever had. She's a lot of fun and you should definitely get her if you can. She's good hearted and loves math! Best teacher ever!", 
            "Jill is THE BEST! She does everything she can for you. Seriously, if you think you are going to have issues with calculus just get into jill's class. She is amazing."

I studied hard and knew every single term on the test and got a B, by missing little nitpicky points here and there. The same thing happened to a lot of other people who did worse than that. I think they want to lower the amount of people who get As.", 
            "David Potter was one of the best professors that I had! He was funny and made the material interesting even though I wasn't that interested in it. The class is straight forward: 2 papers, 2 exams. Make sure to go to discussion and put in some effort. I ended up really enjoying this class and it didn't require much outside work.", 
            "Lectures are extremely boring. I took this class because I thought the topic would be interesting, but it definitely wasn't. However, the class is extremely easy. I went to lecture and discussion, never took notes and barely payed attention but did well.", 
            "Professor Potter is the best professor I've had thus far. Classic Civ is a great class, especially if you love sports. There's some reading (do it), but it's pretty interesting stuff on the evolution of sport. Go to section, go to lecture, and it's an easy A. Only 2 tests and 2 papers. Class was a lotta fun. Tons of guest speakers (incl Lloyd Carr)", 
            "Professor Potter is the man. This was my fourth class with him, and it just keeps getting better. His lectures are very interesting, and he truly wants students to learn. Do most of the reading, go to most of the lectures, and ask for help when it comes to the papers, and you'll get an A. A truly brilliant man.", 
            "Potter has a great sense of humor, and his lectures are pretty interesting. Exams are straight-forward, and if you study it's very easy to do well. Would take this again.", 
            "Very easy class. Readings are primary source of information for the class, lectures aren't necessary to attend. 2 papers and 2 exams.", 
            "The lectures were sometimes dry and confusing, and he reads from texts a lot. However, despite a terrible experience with a GSI, I would recommend the class. Reasonable amount of reading, easy exams, fairly easy (and short) papers.", 
            "Professor Potter is incredibly knowledgeable on the complete history of ancient Rome. He neatly and clearly taught the course and added his own witty commentary on the subject as well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED CLASS", 
            "A really fun topic and a very knowledgable, effective teacher. I would highly recommend this teacher to any student!", 
            "Really easy class, but you can learn a lot of random stuff from it. Potter is a cool prof but I think this class would be a lot better as a seminar because of how easy it is.", 
            "This was the best class I've ever taken. Prof. Potter knows his material very well, he is great to listen to in lecture, and the readings, though many of them, are intresting.Prof. Potter does a great job of relating ancient history with todays events. My favorite quote \"Rome was afraid Carthage would use Elephants of mass destruction.\"", 
            "Cool guy!", 
            "I really love ancient Rome, but did not enjoy this class at all. Potter is a really cool guy, but a lot of lecture is him reading from the book. A LOT of reading, which is important for the essays. The exams were easy to study for, and saved my grade. I stopped going to lecture after the midterm but did just as well on the final. Go to discussion.", 
            "Great knowledgeable teacher. Stopped attending lecture one week into the class. You can easily get an A by doing the readings and studying the lectures. Another GSI based grade. I got over 100% on both exams and got a B+ in the class overall. Good GSI = Good Grade Lots of writing and reading (ULWR). Don't take this class unless you like history.", 
            "pretty hard exams, even if you do the reading because the graders are so picky. 2 exams, 3 essays, hundreds of pages of reading per week. Do not take just for the Humanities credit as there are many easier classes out there. I only recommend for history majors.", 
            "Excellent lecturer. Very easy to listen to. However, he has the unfortunate position of being one of the best teachers I've had, but also teaching a class where you can get an A without attending his lectures. Tons of reading, but if you do it all, study, and work hard on the papers, you can easily get an A without the lectures.", 
            "he is a good professor, speaks well and is knowledgable, even funny at times. the class itself is difficult, a lot of reading, 2 exams and three 5 page papers", 
            "He is one of the University's best professors, he knows everything there is to know about the subject matter and is very enthusiastic about what he teaches. The assignments are all straight forward and the tests are easy if you do the readings. When tested it is always on relevant material and not obscure facts, truly the best teaching philosophy!", 
            "Great professor, I only went to about 10 lectures but they were interesting. Exams were straight forward and the essays were not difficult to do well on. GSI's were very helpful. Highly recommended"

Very relevant course with interesting material. Take this class regardless of your major, you won't regret it. Grades based on participation/attendance, 3 short essays and 3 exams.", 
            "Professor Stiffler was amazing! He made it a class I looked forward to going to every week and the general atmosphere of the class was very open. He is a great professor who is understanding of a college students life and very open to questions. I would highly recommend the course to anyone because it is very relative to life in America today.",

Lecture itself is always engaging, and there are several interesting guest lectures throughout the semester. There's technically a lot of reading, but even if you only half do it and go to class, you'll be fine.",

There is an awesome class field trip to Dearborn, the essays are very easy, the exams are blue book (but the questions are not tough). STM people in LSA should certainly consider taking this class (paired w/harder science classes.", 
            "By far my favorite professor. His lectures are always interesting and he is very clear about topics. Some reading, but if you keep up with it you will do fine. He cares about his students and takes time to discuss current events before the start of lectures. I definitely will take another class with him I loved him that much.",

            "One of the best professors I've had at the University of Michigan. He is very knowledgeable and engaging during lecture. Conveys the material very clearly. Grade is dependent on the GSI. Dr. Stiffler is very professional about topics that can be controversial. Lots of long readings, but you'll be fine if you skim them. Highly recommend.", 
            "Very straight-forward professor with clear expectations and guidelines. Do the readings, which are never terrible and alway relevant, attend class, which is never boring, and try to participate. I ended up taking another one of his classes just because of my experience in this one. Do what he suggest and you WILL do well.", 
            "This was by far my favorite class that I took during my first semester at the University of Michigan! Professor Stiffler is such a wonderful lecturer, and really does a good job of covering such a wide range of topics. I felt like he did a great job of giving a fair representation of everything, and maintained a comfortable atmosphere in class :)",

            "Matthew Stiffler is an amazing lecturer and knows the material he teaches and is clearly passionate about it. If you paid attention, did the work, and attended lecture and section, an A is definitely possible. Don't let a GSI determine whether or not you will take this class. Stiffler is amazing and makes you think critically about the subject.", 
            "The professor is okay, but GSI basically wants to fail everyone even though he doesn't know the material himself. Avoid if you can!", 
            "This class and the professor were very lackluster. I had high hopes going in, but he keep the discussion very politically correct and didn't discuss anything remotely thought-provoking. Mandatory attendance, lots of reading, and a very hard grader. The class was more work than I bargained for, and it was very hard to get an A.", 
            "VERY interesting class since I had no previous knowledge on Arab Americans. Dr. Stiffler is very nice, good lecturer, there's a lot of reading (articles from cTools) but you can get away with not reading them all the time. The grading was much harsher than I expected. I received a B on the first essay and an A- on the 2nd. GSI harsher grader", 
            "He's such a cutie! This class was so easy and a good way to get rid of your humanities requirement. I got a B on the midterm but aced the project, so I got an A. There isn't a lot of work."

As long as one does their online homework, they should do fine. Learn the material on your own, then come to lecture to do practice problems which are rather helpful. Do no expect to learn in lecture.",

            "This class is a mere exercise in copying Collins' lectures into your notebook and regurgitating them onto the exam. A large portion of the exam was \"matching,\" which I had not been faced with since elementary school and have not encountered since in college. Collins is obviously very learned, but does not seem to believe his students to be bright.", 
            "hands down the best class i've taken at UofM. his presentation of the subject matter is fascinating, and he keeps it interesting by being funny and showing (not always relevant but cool) movie clips. you HAVE to go to lecture and read, but you'll want to. really enjoyable, amazing lecturer- TAKE IT! exams are easy if you pay attention", 
            "He's super smart and a total stud...in that \"really amazing and totally put together suave gentlemanly way\". Pretty much melt when he looks at you. Plus, he's absolutely brilliant and relaxed.", 
            "The coolest prof I've had at the U. Speaks with clarity, plays movies in class, and makes the class fun. A very endearing man. You can tell this guy is brilliant, not only as an academic, but as a teacher as well. Seriously, he's the man; take anything with him.", 
            "Excellent Prof! Very very helpful, although the material is tough, but anyone taking Greek will tell you that.", 
            "Derek is AMAZING!!! he is soooo hot and he usually plays movie clips that relate to Greek myth at least 2 times a week. This class is interesting and easy if you go to lecture, because he pretty much tells you what you need to know for the exams", 
            "There is one term paper that you get to research a topic of your choosing. The exams can be slightly tricky, but go to lecture and you'll do fine. Professor Collins is a funny guy and knows what he is talking about. Going to lecture is like going to story time. The movie clips are priceless.", 
            "Entertaining, and incredibly intelligent. And definitely very attractive.", 
            "Great class, hot teacher... if you go to all the lectures, you will not need to read, if you have a good memory that is.... He is super hot!!", 
            "He is awesome. He really knows what he is talking about and he loves what he does. He's very funny and makes class fun to attend. It was very laid back!", 
            "great teacher. loves what he does. great looking and funny!", 
            "Really good prof and good guy. Wants everyone to do well and understand the topic. Gives out study sheets and pretty much explains what will be on the exams. Go to class to get a good understanding of the material and there's no point in doing the readings.", 
            "witchcraft - Very interesting subject matter, lectures quite dry though because he doesn't use slides- hard to follow- but a billion percent an Easy A if you attend discussion and get the notes from someone. DEF take this, and such a cute prof", 
            "He writes down the names you need to know for the exam and he gives out a review sheet. He always is willing to meet with students to help them and genuinely cares about his students and how well they do in and enjoy his classes.", 
            "Awsome class", 
            "i love greek myth...and now, i love this professor. he made the class very entertaining. plus...hes hot.", 
            "He made the lectures interesting AND entertaining", 
            "I second all the compliments. A top teacher.", 
            "Professor Collins is a very good professor. He has a lot of knowledge and a lot of passion when he teaches. Likes to do things like connect modern movies with the myths we read. Says \"um\" a lot. Good looking guy...gives off a George Clooney vibe", 
            "One of the top 5 professors. If you remotely know what is going on in class you will do fine. The first half of the class is a lot easier than the second, though. But I have to add his lectures are amazing: he plays random movies like Matrix and even says it doesn't relate. Also, he is also obsessed with sex and makes tons of ****ed jokes."

            "Andy was great, he made the best of a really boring course. He didn't have a lot of leeway in what the workload was like, but he did his best to make the class interesting and even though I did not enjoy the class, Andy was a fun professor.", 
            "Andy is the bomb. He's always so cheery in class, you would never know it if he was having an off day. He's also just overall very nice and really helpful if you ever have questions. Only 3 essays all year, and you can correct your mistakes to get 5 percentage points back. Wrote me the nicest note on my last essay of the year.", 
            "Andy is a really nice guy and class isn't too boring. But he is a much tougher grader than I expected. I am struggling to get a B, along with almost all of my classmates. He also contradicts himself a lot and sometimes is confusing. His spanish also seems to be pretty Americanized and sometimes he doesn't know how to answer our questions.", 
            "Andy kind of intimidated me the entire semester I took his class but I learned a lot and really improved my Spanish conversation skills. I really liked most of the movies we watched and that's really your only homework besides studying for weekly vocab quizzes. Oral midterm and final, definitely need to study a lot but overall a helpful class!", 
            "Andy is the best Spanish teacher I have had at Michigan. He goes out of his way to make sure people understand the material. I learned a ton of new and usual vocab from this class and got to practice my speaking and comprehension. I am not good at spanish and needed to take this class for my major and I found it very manageable.", 
            "This class was very boring and dumb. The movies were good, but we did the same game during class and his vocab quizzes are cumulative and the random grammar he puts on them is annoying. I don't really recommend this class even though it isn't too much work.", 
            "Very unhelpful. It's a Spanish conversation class but he spent most of it talking in English. Same games every day, literally no instruction the whole semester. Refused to give any feedback both in class & on homework, and became quite rude when I asked him to correct my HW- said I should get a tutor if I wanted feedback. Your Spanish won't improve", 
            "Andy is a really great teacher! He is very caring and helpful; I'm really glad I took this class. I feel like I learned a lot and the material was interesting, and the class was not difficult either.", 
            "Andy is a great professor. Class is really laid back and the work is not hard. He is a harder grader than you may think but it's still easy to do well.", 
            "Andy is an incredible professor. He began every class with lively Spanish music and he strove to make every class engaging. Andy made class fly by with his entertaining games, movies and tv clips of Anthony Bourdain. It is truly a joy to take his class and I highly recommend him to anyone that is taking a Spanish class.", 
            "Andy was always willing to help students. He held review sessions before the tests, gave us a review packet and would meet with students outside of office hours if a student needed help. After the first test I was worried about the class but with Andy's help I was able to end up with a good grade. Andy's a great teacher & you should take his class", 
            "Andy is a great professor that cares about his students. He's always available to help students and actually wants you to succeed and do well. Spanish teachers are notoriously bad at teaching/hard graders, but I found Andy to be clear and fair in his grading. I definitely suggest taking a class with him.", 
            "Andy is a fantastic teacher. I used to dread going to spanish four days a week, but his classes are very well planned out and ALWAYS interesting. He does everything he can to be clear and is willing to help with anything you need. Overall a great teacher that I would recommend more than anything!", 
            "Andy is such a great spanish teacher. He really wants us to learn spanish and cares about his students. He makes his lecture interesting and fun. He knows what works and doesn't work with teaching spanish and the best way to learn because he was a student just like us. I highly recommend him he's the best", 
            "Andy is such an amazing professor. He really cares about his students and makes an effort to make class enjoyable. He made me not completely dread coming to spanish class for the first time ever. Andy is the best!", 
            "Awesome teacher who really cares about students doing well. Class is planned out very well and easy to follow. It is easy to do well in this class if you show you are trying and study the handouts he gives you. Made me like Spanish a lot more than I did coming in!",

Lectures are largely example based (and corresponded almost directly to homework and exam problems), which worked very well for me.", 
            "Bogdan is a friendly genius. ME 240 with him was not bad, he does a plethera of practice examples and gives you a good thought process on how to attack each problem. He prefers to solve problems without variables rather than numbers which to me was very helpful for you could better see the thought process. Great teacher", 
            "Actually did 240 a few years back, recently did some research with him. He's super inspiring and makes you think, really glad to be his student!", 
            "Best I had at Michigan. He is fantastic in class and very compassionat. Helps student learn very nice.", 
            "Professor Bogdan is hands down the best professor I have had at Michigan. He's very engaging with students, he addresses all questions asked, he knows the material extremely well, and his lectures are very clear and concise. His exams are very fair and truly test your knowledge of the material. An all around great guy and a wonderful professor!", 
            "Hardest class so far, but Bogdan is one of the better professors I have had, any other class and it would've been an A+ with him teaching. Weekly homework to turn in, and a few computer assignments, 3 exams that are all based off book problems, except he hates numbers, so you are given variables for everything. You need to show up and attention.", 
            "I took this class for general elective credit and Epureanu has been one of the best professors I've ever had, easily in the top 3. He's extremely intelligent, his lectures are very clear and help immensely with homeworks, and he is a very fair test maker. All around great class and a fantastic professor", 
            "Don't think he is as good as the comments are saying. Lectures were fast pace, somewhat unclear. For the vibrations part, his lecture was not helpful when I prepare for final", 
            "Seemed on top of his game. Brilliant, but still lectures clearly on a student-level (doesn't dumb it down, but isn't insanely tough). Very clear. Talks fast, and his handwriting on the board somehow keeps up, but engaging lecturer. Definitely one of my top profs.", 
            "Bogdan is by far one of the best professors I've had at U-M. Took ME 240, dynamics, and he is very clear and explains everything very well. Does everything on the whiteboard and doesn't post notes online so you need to attend classes, but you'd be a fool not to after you sit through the first lecture. Great teacher", 
            "He is an excellent professor. One of the best I have had at Michigan and I highly recommend him. Great lectures and there aren't any surprises on exams and homework's.",

            "Accounting is a tough subject to understand - honestly, either it comes naturally to you or it doesn't. That's why this class is easily a struggle for a majority of the students. Use the textbook and PAL sessions as much as you can. Tough class, but that's because it's a tough subject. Bird is overall nice and wants students to understand.",

I absolutely hated this material and I was awful at it. Her Office hours are packed and only relatively helpful. I would suggest a tutor if you end up with her. And attend the PALs sessions!!!", 
            "Bird is great! To be honest, I was very unmotivated throughout most of the semester so I found it difficult to focus in lecture. But when I eventually did, I realized that she is very good at explaining the material. GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS. They were tremendously helpful. She was very supportive, kind, and understood my problems with the material.",

She was somewhat condescending if someone asked a stupid question, but only if she had already covered it or the question really was dumb. Definitely the best intro accounting professor, You have to read the book, but her lectures focus the most important topics for exams.",

She almost never goes over how to do calculations, and called her students \"products\" of Ross. I tried to meet with her outside of class & she didn't emailed me back. I taught myself this material mostly.",

It was clear she only wanted to talk about what she was interested in. Did not learn about any interesting controversies, or learn new writing techniques. Would not recommend", 
            "She is very approachable and although she lectures slowly, it's good for people like me who usually takes longer time to learn than other people. She explains the concepts really thoroughly and is a very nice human being in general. Don't need to avoid her.", 
            "She presents the material very clearly. She moves a little slowly, which is nice at times but also makes you feel rushed leading up to exams. Exams are typically significantly more difficult than her lectures lead on though.", 
            "In my opinion, Mapp was the best 215 prof for this semester. She does spend a lot of time reviewing and talking about the practicality of an experiemnt (which no one really cares about). This sometimes makes her fall behind the other professors but I found her reviews super helpful. She's overall super nice, approachable, and a great teacher.", 
            "Definitely very cheery and loves the subject. Between her, Zurcher, and Nagorny, she is the best since she writes the exams. She spends a lot of time reviewing, about 30 mins, so it's like one topic over 2 days. She doesn't do many practice examples and just goes over the basics. Definitely hit up office hours to get specific questions answered.", 
            "Her voice is very annoying and her exams give almost no partial credit. Orgo 2 is easier than Orgo 1 but it's hard to get a good grade because you will lose a ridiculous amount of points for a simple mistake. She sounds very nervous during lecture and messes up a lot.", 
            "Really energetic during class which keeps you awake. Notes are clear and she is great at explaining concepts clearly. The class is tough by nature but she makes sure you know what is expected of you on exams, and is helpful if you ask her coursepack questions beforeafter lectures. If you email her, that's another story though.",

Mapp explains things clearly and is always willing to answer questions. Sometimes it seems like she's a little nervous but it just makes her more endearing. Overall, I think she was the best orgo 2 prof this semester!", 
            "Professor Mapp made suffering through Chem 215 okay. I was one who struggled in Chem 210 and saw a significant improvement in 215 thanks to Mapp. She explains concepts clearly and is so cheery for every lecture. She also gives you a history lesson on who discovered what concepts which is completely unnecessary but a refreshing break.", 
            "Very good lecturer, but the exams are basically geared so that you lose a lot of points for little mistakes. A very slippery slope from an A.",

            "Dr. Mapp is a really great professor. The boards got a bit crowded with ideas at times during lecture, but nothing too bad if you're following along. She posted tons of extra stuff online to prepare students for the exams. She made orgo II really interesting and even incorporated some biochem stuff into lecture, which was cool too.",

            "Good orgo teacher. Was very thorough and clear with the concepts that NEEDED to be known for the exams. Since the material for each exam changes from year to year, she is great because she clearly delineates what needs to be known. Trying to tie in biochem concepts (different drugs and proteins) makes the class a more convoluted than necessary", 
            "Wow. I'm surprised by the high reviews Mapp has received. I got an A+ in Orgo II, and I can honestly say that she had nothing to do with it. She consistently fell behind the other professors, she reviewed more than she taught, she really just wanted to teach biochem. She'd be a good teacher if you were 14 years old, but you're in Michigan Orgo."

            "great person, loved her", 
            "Lucia is a hilarious and interesting person, but perhaps not the BEST SAC professor (in terms of teaching). Lectures are very hard to follow sometimes, but all the info for the exams are from the book. Dont bother taking notes :P. Lots and lots of essays in class...but Lucia got Faye Dunaway to visit us and that was great.", 
            "Lucia is witty and hilarious; it's not difficult to stay engaged during lecture.", 
            "worst film teacher at the U of M", 
            "Get a good GSI. There is no organization or uniformity among discussion sections and having a good GSI will make all the difference. Due dates and requirements are different for each section. Lucia changed the syllabus multiple times and still never stuck to it. This is a very poorly organized course, and you probably won't learn much.", 
            "Her Ctools site needs to be organized. She also did not post the final study guide until less than 2 nights before the test. Her study guide was SO DIFFERERNT from the one the GSIs kindly make and gave to her and us beforehand (b/c she hadn't made one). Clearly it didn't occur to her that we'd already been studying the GSI's study guide for days!", 
            "I LOVE LUCIA!!!!! I have had her for SAC 236 and 272, and would def take another one of her classes. She manages to make reeeeally dry material interesting, and if you go to lecture you hardly have to do any reading. Definitely take her class.", 
            "Lucia is a really fun, great prof! Her lectures are very helpful. Theory gets uninteresting very fast but she keeps you entertained. She wastes some time in class but you'll learn the material. She's not as easy a grader as her attitude towards grades would suggest. I would recommend taking her classes, though.", 
            "Lucia is lots of fun & a great lecturer. She can get off topic but it keeps you listening. The class is easy if you pay attention and/or do the readings. She gives great study guides for the tests. However, she's very disorganized and it can get annoying. She takes long to post things on CTools & my GSI never got access to the site.", 
            "Best teacher ever. Take her class.", 
            "I can't imagine taking SAC 236 with anyone else. Lucia is by far the most interesting and entertaining professor I have had after 3 years at U of M. She is easy if you listen to her and do some of the readings, really straight forward.", 
            "Lucia is definitely an amusing prof, though the class is a little disorganized. She doesn't use Powerpoint, like the people below me have said, so you better take notes. Her dog was hilarious, and yes, someone yelled at him during our final (winter '08 semester). If you are going to take SAC 236, take it with Lucia.", 
            "she is by far the most entertaining teacher at this school. i look forward to going to her lectures. Her knowledge of film is vast and interesting. She is also the most helpfull teacher and will go the extra distance to make sure you are doing well in her class if you aproach her. Take a class with Lucia Saks", 
            "First of all,Lucia has nothing to do with Lenin. Second of all,she is a wealth of film experience and knowledge always willing to discuss class or even good films with her students.She is wonderfully colorful,but she can get off topic in lecture and ramble.The exams and assignments are easy and, they do teach you what a film beginner SHOULD know.", 
            "The person who just commented is probably a ridiculous student who thinks that the only commendable attribute of a teacher is how nice she is. Saks is atrocious. She doesn't use lecture slides and just rambles about nothing. People sit in lecture and play addictinggames on their computers the entire time. If you like Saks, you probably like Lenin.", 
            "The guy below me yelled during the final today at Teddy. How can you be mad at a dog? Anyway, Lucia is the nicest teacher you can possibly ask for. Very nice and helpful when you talk to her and helps you understand the films. Make sure you read the book and coursepack for the exams. There is A LOT of material from them but 99% is straight forward.", 
            "\"Professor\" Saks is one of the worst teachers I have ever had in my entire life. She is highly unprofessional in a variety of ways, including forcing her overly liberal political opinion on her students and bringing her annoying and distracting dog to class and exams. Do not take her class.", 
            "BEST PROFESSOR. i love her. overall easy class ifyou have a nice gsi. she doesn't do any of the grading so if u get a good gsi u'll be fine.", 
            "Amazing class! Lucia is the best! SHe brings her dog to class and you get to watch great movies! Exams and papers are not hard. Fun easy Humanities class! Avoid Kristy though as a GSI. Although she is nice, she is a tough teacher", 
            "I learnt a lot in the class from Professor Saks. She made lecture very enjoyable and I always looked forward to going every day."

            "Wasn't really sure what I was getting into with a class about city politics, but I was somewhat surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Definitely learned a lot about how the world really works. Wish I could take another class with him.", 
            "I REALLY enjoyed this class. Lectures were interesting and discussion was fun. I learned A LOT. Papers aren't bad if you pay attention. I'd highly recommend taking this class.", 
            "Great professor. Yes, he does take a liberal stance on everything taught, but has enough nonpartisan data to back it up. Discussion sections were great, the papers were essentially making a thesis out of the lectures. Great guy, really got me thinking about my life choices and made me feel aware of what was happening in America.", 
            "Took this class last year and I loved it. It's amazing how a professor can keep your attention when they're talking about issues they really care about. Wasn't the easiest class ever, but he was very fair. Great prof, great class. *fun fact* word on the street is Markus has been in 15 Iron Man competitions. I haven't been to the CCRB in 2 years", 
            "Terrific professor. Really appreciate that he learns everyones name\u2014a rarity these days. Writes a few key terms on the board, and the rest of the class is carried by his 42 to years of teaching experience (yes, he's been teaching courses at Mich twice as long as I've been alive...) Great GSI too, I wish she'd talk more since she seems cool.", 
            "I'm rather conservative so I was a bit skeptical coming in, but I actually found the class to be fairly neutral. I think there's a difference between \"opinion\" and \"perspective,\" and Markus taught from the latter. When he said things that weren't widely considered or proven to be fact, he made it clear that it was his opinion. Good class.", 
            "Markus' blatant political slant can be annoying, but his class is still definitely worth your time. I guarantee you will come away with a solid understanding of what's going on in our nation. I wouldn't complain if this class was mandatory for each LSA student. Markus does a good job and the grading is incredibly generous.", 
            "EXCUSE ME - but I assumed if I was intelligent enough to be accepted to UM then I AM intelligent enough to make a thoughtful analysis of any information provided to me. I DO NOT need this guy to spoon feed me his liberal nonsense! Only assigned readings to support his liberal views or knock conservatives. So much for a liberal arts education!", 
            "This class may or may not be worth your time. Markus presents an interesting analysis of domestic politics, but does it in perhaps the most juvenile way possible. Although I'm liberal, it was immensely frustrating when he dismissed all conservative views as idiocy without justification. If you live in a fantasy world, this might be a good class.", 
            "VERY LIBERAL. If you are fairly conservative, you would be able to learn the Democratic argument from a man who knows EVERYTHING about contemporary politics. He takes great pride in providing the best possible readings for the class. His GSI are always on point, because he doesn't put up with any BS. Markus is an expert, take his class.", 
            "Favorite Professor at the University. Changed rewrite policy to BENEFIT students. Grades very tough but is crystal clear about what he expects. Extremely liberal, but backs EVERYTHING up with accurate facts. Knows EXACTLY what he is talking about. Fantastic community service opportunities in Detroit. Great role model; great teacher; great man. A+", 
            "I knew about his liberal bias going in to the class, so that didn't bother me. I was appalled by his lack of regard for students. He routinely dismissed clarification questions about assignments and decried those who did not do well as lazy or poorly read. Also, he changed rewrite policies half way through the class over strenuous student objection", 
            "An angry and small minded man. You go to his class to learn, but instead you are subjected to a one-sided, extremist liberal diatribe. A disgrace to the University of Michigan. I challenged him frequently in class and all he did was bring up lame anecdotes. He even resorted to crocodile tears at one point. Pathetic class, awful teacher. Retire now!", 
            "Did a great job teaching, and obviously cares about his students. He obviously is quite liberal, but he only bothers to talk about liberal viewpoints that he can actually back up with facts, which is nice. Just 5 five page papers, GSI graded (mine was pretty lenient). I found this class to be very informative, and would recommend to all majors.", 
            "Very bad at helping, and rude! I emailed him twice asking what he meant on one of the assignments, and he told me to use a dictionary, twice. Not helpful. And he had a very demeaning tone to it.", 
            "Markus is very Liberal, but defends his views with data and explanations. If you are a fantasy-world Libertarian, this class is not for you. However, if you are moderate or moderately conservative, then you will benefit greatly from the large amounts of data given in the class that will help you to better argue your political philosophy.", 
            "This professor is off the deep end. He says he is unbiased but then slams every conservative view as crazy. He is the epitome of a indocrinating professor. He should give back his salary to the tax paying citizens for the harm he has caused.", 
            "Loved this class. Learned a lot from hearing him speak in lecture (and you have to go since there are no Power Points). Yes, he is liberal, but he presents facts that I checked when I was skeptical. The readings are all unbiased as well. Grading depends on GSI. Favorite class so far.", 
            "There is no need to attend lecture, buy the books, or spend more than a few hours on the papers for a class led by Gregory Markus. He is an extremely boring and repetitive lecture, the book readings are completely unnecessary for the papers (just use the online readings), and the papers are pretty easy. Easy class -- just boring.", 
            "Although he may be liberal, he provides facts and those who call him a crazy liberal are just unable to grasp the truth. I consider myself to be fairly conservative and I very much enjoyed this class. It makes you question and critically look at the world as we live it every day. He's oldschool-chalkboard, no powerpts which I enjoyed. Very nice too"

            "Dr. Miller is extremely organized so you know exactly what is expected. You are expected to go to lecture and print out the notes before class. Lecture is really just them filling out the blank notes but attendance counts. There is always one homework assignment per week. Very willing to answer questions. Talks about their dogs a lot.", 
            "I think Dr. Miller is great. No surprises on the exams and they're very caring. If you follow the reviews and the in-class examples they prepare, you'll do great. There isn't a curve, but it shouldn't be breaking news to anyone that a STATS professor at a prestigious, research university, with 300+ students is going to curve. You don't need one.", 
            "If you're the type of person who doesn't perform on exams, this class isn't for you. The class is graded on a straight scale that leaves no room for mistakes; the graders are obsessive about nickel and diming. Lectures weren't helpful and I don't feel that I learned very much. Material is easy and should be an easy A but the scale is ridiculous.", 
            "Dr. Miller is not only a phenomenal professor, they're also hilarious. Would crack a ton of jokes during lecture that kept me interested and also got the point across. I would recommend taking stats 250 with them over every other professor. Super accessible in office hours, they're solely the reason I like stats as much as I do.", 
            "If you're a \"non-math person\" like myself, I would easily recommend Professor Miller. Lectures were very clearly and straight-forward but what sets them aside is office hours. Professor Miller goes above and beyond to help you understand the material and is just a genuinely nice person.", 
            "Awesome professor. Super friendly, always smiling, and does a good job of explaining difficult material. Office hours are helpful if you're confused about anything. Dr. Miller is very patient when you have questions, and a very easy professor to talk to. I'm the furthest thing from a \"math person,\" but I'd take the class again if need be.", 
            "This is by FAR the worst class I have taken in this school. The professor contributes highly to that opinion. The lectures are painfully slow and there is hardly any explanation of the math behind the material. The professor just tells you it is how it is. Very difficult to stay interested, AND THERE IS NO CURVE. Bad professor, boring class.", 
            "Totally mess! She does not emphasize any essence of statistics, instead, the professor used dogmatism to regulate you. when answering very easy questions The material of the course is too easy. I didn't learn anything in this course.", 
            "Eng. students who like proof-based mathematics: Take this class to fulfill your stats requirement, and then take math 451/stats 425/500-levels for deeper/proofier understanding. I tried to take stats 426 two semesters in a row, dropped both times b/c of AWFUL profs. Meanwhile, Dr. Miller is the most fair/clear/organized prof. I've ever had. 10/10", 
            "Dr. Miller explained things well and clearly which helped for exams and homework. I know that everyone recommends Gunderson, but personally I prefer and would recommend Dr. Miller. Dr. Miller also has a good sense of humor which helps to make stats which can sometimes be dry and dense into a more enjoyable experience.", 
            "I like Dr. Miller! I know most people will opt for Dr. Gunderson, but I honestly prefer Dr. Miller's style of teaching! Very clear, and takes extra time to go over some concepts to make sure that students really grasp them well. Definitely suitable for me because I take time when it comes to Maths. Recommended!", 
            "Dr. Miller is absolutely awesome. The course is pretty easy: requires about 1-2 hours for the online homework and a half hour for the easy prelabs each week and then studying for the exams. The lectures were available online so you didn't really have to attend except for labs. Also, Dr. Miller is easy to reach, helpful and funny.", 
            "Dr. Miller was not my stats professor, but I watched her lecture recordings online. She is very engaging, funny, and informative. The lectures were very easy to follow. I would recommend watching Dr. Miller's lecture stream to any stats student!", 
            "Dr. Miller is a real gem. No, really. Cares about every student. Hilarious lectures (I appreciate a good, dry sense of humor). Dr. Miller gives in-depth explanations of every problem, welcomes any question, and makes sure all understand. The hy-flex live-streamed classes were great backup. I wish Dr. Miller could teach all my classes!", 
            "Miller is funny, engaging, and obviously very bright. The lectures cover the material efficiently and in language that is easy to understand. Miller is the best. Everyone loves Gunderson, but Miller is much more engaging and very passionate.", 
            "Miller was a great lecturer, but it doesn't matter who you really take because attendance is optional. Either watch Miller or Gunderson both are good. I suck at math in general so I'm not doing that well but it's my own fault because I fell behind in lectures. If you do your work you should be fine and the curve of the class helps.", 
            "Dr. Miller is certainly the best option of the stats lecturers. Dr. Gunderson is great, but she isn't very entertaining (she is just easier to understand), but Dr. Miller is a great option. Dr. Miller is a funny soul with great energy. Totally recommend taking this stats class.", 
            "Very good professor and she uses the online streaming software, so you do not even need to attend your lectures. You can stay home and watch online, or you can skip them and watch at another time convenient for you! Tests aren't that hard and don't require too much studying. Funny lectures sometimes", 
            "Dr. Miller was an excellent Stats teacher. Every lecture was incredibly thorough, and I rarely left class confused or with my questions unanswered. Dr. Miller also has a great dry sense of humor that made class a little less monotonous. Though most people say taking Stats with Gunderson is a must, I preferred Miller's lectures. :)", 
            "For Stats250 it does not matter who your professor is. Watch Miller or Gunderson's lectures are recorded and both explain the information well. If you want to do well, fill out your whole workbook, go to lab, and ask questions about tiny details. Details make the difference on exams. 80% of your grade is your exams. There are 2 tests and 1 final."

            "Exams are poorly worded and refuses to consider other option choices. iClicker is extra credit so I suggest going to lecture. Memorize the slides (lots if info), no need to read the book. Disrespectful/snarky at times but does decent job teaching but sometimes glosses over stuff that shows up on the exam.", 
            "Her lectures are very boring and her exams consist of about 50 multiple choice questions. The MC can get confusing cause many of them consist of answer choices like C: All of the above, D: A and B, etc, so make sure you know your material. Memorize the lecture slides (MEMORIZE THEM), you don't need to do the readings to do well on the exams.",

She has become a whole different professor for the second exam. Useless lectures, focuses on the least relevant material and its completely unclear what we need to know for the exam.", 
            "Not only does Professor Pavgi put together a meaningless course where no real concepts are taught and no novel intellect is gained, but she is also one of the most disrespectful professors I've encountered. She shows minimal regard for her students and often makes snarky comments when in lab. She lacks professionalism and just downright compassion",

You have to put the time in for this class and study the material, but the exams are very straightforward. She is not trying to trick you. Easy to do well in if you put in the effort. One of my favorite classes I've taken at umich", 
            "Dr. Pavgi is great! Her tests are more than fair, very straightforward. You don't have to read the textbook at all, everything is based on her lectures. It would benefit you to attend class b/c she gives extra credit clicker questions that could really help you. Best way to study is to just re watch the lectures & take notes. Very manageable class!",

            "Lectures were terrible. Complete lack of organization, gives convoluted explanations of concepts, always going from one concept to the next with little to no connections. This makes the class harder since it's entirely lecture based. Exams cover lecture material, but poor wording/grammar of questions makes them far more difficult than necessary.", 
            "While Dr. Pavgi is a nice person, she is not a good lecturer by any means. Her lectures (and notes) were incoherent and disorganized which made studying for lectures difficult. The content would otherwise be interesting but the delivery is so bad that it's hard to appreciate. Do NOT recommend, you should take it another semester with another prof.", 
            "Dr. Pavgi, while not the best lecturer, cares an incredible amount about her students. Animal Phys is content heavy, but if you take the time to go to OHs and go over your exams/study skills, you will see results. I didn't want to follow her advice at first because I was convinced I knew how to study, but now I'll never study another way again.", 
            "She is a good lecturer and the lectures are recorded so you can go back and watch them to catch details you missed. I HIGHLY recommend going to class though. You can earn extra points that way. The class is entirely exam based and the questions are very detailed. Lots of studying required. If you put the time in, you'll be fine.",

She wants all of her students to do well. She has an optional final at the end which usually moves students up a full grade. Fairly easy to get an A if you put in the effort", 
            "At first I was a bit concerned coming into a public speaking class, but Donahue built up our confidence and made it fun. Some assignments seemed to be a bit tedious at the time, but she had reason for all of it. I'd definitely take a course with her again and all that we learned in SM 101 can be useful in other courses and the professional world.",

She paired the super boring readings with interesting ones to cut out the monotony of it all. The exams were graded pretty roughly, but you get the hang of it. Do a decent job on the optional final and it will boost your grade for sure. I recommend!",

            "Ms. D is awesome! She is so willing to help you whenever you have questions, and she grades presentations way easier than I expected. Watch out for her written exams and papers--she takes off for weird things. Also, an INSANE workload for an intro class. Just stay on top of your stuff and you'll be fine. Ms. D is great :)",

Greek is a difficult language to begin with, and there is a lot of material one needs to cover to get a basic understanding of how the language works. Lots of homework is a necessity. She is amazing! I'm in Greek 301 now, and you need a solid foundation to build upon. She provided that!", 
            "Professor Forsdyke is a very nice person however she does not teach the language. She assigns homework at the end of every class then the next lecture we have just enough time to go over the homework before class is up. Essentially we are teaching ourselves Greek from the book which is just as hard as it sounds. This class is very fast paced.", 
            "Sweetest lady ever! One of the best lecturers I've had to date. Interesting material as well. The class was also really easy. Refreshing break from my engineering classes.", 
            "Class was both easy and interesting, a rare combination that should not be missed. Also, I feel like I learned a lot, and Prof. Forsdyke respected the students' opinions and offered thought-provoking discussion. So, wins all around.", 
            "Amazing professor! She is passionate about the subject and highly knowledgeable. Sweet woman, always willing to help our and answer questions. The class is easy if you do the readings and pay attention in lecture. She gave us the essay questions for the midterm and final ahead of time, so there is no way you can do poorly in the class.", 
            "Prof Forsdyke is an awesome professor who really cares about the class and the topic. The class is pretty interesting, and not very difficult at all. Periodic quizzes, response papers, and a midterm/final determine grade, but none of which are too challenging if you do the readings and listen in class.", 
            "Her class wasn't very difficult, and some of the material was interesting. She definitely cared about her subject. Be sure to participate in class discussions.",

            "Nice person, but class wasn't what I expected. Awful GSI's, which is a problem because they grade everything. I expected this class to be about mythology and the like, but it's basically a history class. I wouldn't take it for my first year writing.",

            "i took this class for a requirement, and wasn't that interested in it, but it's obvious that she LOVED the subject matter. very supportive; the GSIs, not so much. quizzes basically counted for participation only, which was wonderful. way better than great books 191! i didn't notice the \"uh\"/\"um\" thing as much as other people, i suppose.", 
            "Prof Forsdyke is very interested in what she's teaching, and really wants us to get excited it all too, especially the authors she chooses. She tries to get students involved in lectures because she actually cares and wants the students to do well. I've never heard anything bad about any of the GSIs either, i love mine!", 
            "This was by far my favorite class this semester. Sara is truly interested in her subject, and that shows. I guess I lucked out because my GSI is the best. I love my section and she is so helpful and cares if we do well or not. There is a lot of reading, but if you are interested in Greek history or lit, this is definitely a great class for you.", 
            "Her GSI's shouldn't even be allowed to teach at MSU.", 
            "Forsdyke may be a nice woman, but her lectures are useless. Paper only count, which are graded by the HORRIBLE GSI's. Don't take for the writing requirement bc you will learn nothing about writing. Way too much reading/writing to be of any use. Will read 3 books a week and spend 20 mins in class discussing them. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!", 
            "She definitely knows what she's talking about and that usually comes across very well. However, I don't feel as though there's much cohesion within the course - it feels like eleven different books thrown together without much common purpose. Overall, though, a very enjoyable class with a professor who seems to truly care about what she's doing.", 
            "Prof Forsdyke is such a great prof. I usually hate powerpoints, but she really uses them efficiently in getting the points across. She is so smart and knows so much about Ancient Slavery, as well as practically everything else about the ancient world. She is totally straightforward. Do the reading and you will get an A- to A+, guaranteed!"

Seeing her outside of class is very easy.",

Compared to the other Eng 125 sections which wrote papers all the time, this class literally has like 3, 5-page papers and a video assignment at the end. The readings got a bit tedious sometimes but I thought that the discussion was valuable. There were no exams.", 
            "Kelly Allen is a really tough professor. She makes you work exceptionally hard to get the grade, but if you put in a good effort and go to office hours she will reward your efforts. She posts everything online from readings, class notes, & the entire daily schedule so you have everything at your fingertips. GO TO OFFICE HOURS and start papers early",

            "Allen is seriously the best teacher at this school. Her lectures are cool and she's really a great person. Some of her views are stuck in the 1950's but she encourages and respects other opinions and discussion in the class. Attendance isn't mandatory but she gives lecture quizzes that are specific. There are two papers that she does grade tough.",

Her class isn't \"hard\", but there are A LOT of peer editing workshops, rough drafts for papers, extensive outlines for every reading, and these \"reflection\" papers.

Her lectures are really boring.",

I have to admit that the class can be very boring at times, but it was very manageable and a good GPA booster (if you do the work that is). Go to her office hours, she's always willing to help and tell you what she's looking for.",

            "Hands down one of the best professors I've ever had. Calc 1 is notably a very challenging course, however, Fernando is an excellent teacher and will go out of his way to help you out. He's seriously so kind, he brought us snacks frequently and was very understanding. He wants everyone to succeed and gives many opportunities for extra credit.", 
            "Fernando is the best professor I've had at UMich. He is so caring and respects the students. He is very invested in the students and is willing to go out of his way to help.", 
            "One of the best professors I have ever met at Michigan. He clearly cares about all his students and takes time to work through problems with you. Put in effort and participate in class and the exams won't be too hard.", 
            "Fernando's class is taught entirely by his GSIs, but he structures the lectures which are extremely engaging. Tons of practice problems and extremely helpful with any questions you may have. Quizzes and exams are clear and graded more than fair. Only tough part was the team homework, but his GSIs are happy to help.", 
            "Fernando is an amazing professor. Each class he is able to answer any questions you have and clarify anything you don't understand. Team homework was rough, and some quizzes were tricky, but if you prepare with what he provides you, you'll do just fine.", 
            "What can I say that hasn't been said? Fernando is a wonderful professor who really cares about his students and wants you to succeed. Extremely helpful and patient with everyone.", 
            "This professor is wonderful and you'd be very lucky to be his student. He is a nice man and his lectures are very engaging. Class consists of his instruction plus free time to work in groups on various problems. Take all the practice exams and go over every question you missed. This will help tremendously when it comes to the actual exams.", 
            "I had to take this class to apply for the business minor! I was really nervous for it because I hadn't taken a math class since AP Statistics my senior year of high school, but Professor Carreon does his best to encourage you! I don't know how I managed to pull off the grade I did, but bless those curves on the exams :)", 
            "Fernando was definitely the best math professor I could have had! He makes his lectures interactive and wants you to do well. He will go out of his way to help you succeed. Would take again.", 
            "Definitely the most responsible prof ive ever met. His lectures are really clear too. He cares a lot about his student and would patiently answer every question you have.", 
            "All around great guy. Clearly ,his goal is for you to understand the intuition and motivation behind the math. Provides insights that can't be learned from solely reading the text. Very nice and will help if you ask for it. Exams were very tough but that is due to the difficulty of the class more so than the instructor.", 
            "Fernando is an excellent teacher. He's extremely helpful, and you can tell that he is there to help out his students. During lectures, he makes them interactive enough where you won't fall asleep, and he makes sure that he clarifies something for you if you don't understand it. The tests are ok. They can get difficult but are also curved.", 
            "The greatest instructor I have had at Michigan! He explains everything really clearly and is good about moving around the room to see if everyone is understanding. I was scared to take PreCalc becuase I hadn't had a math class in years, but he realky prepared us well for exams. Take his section for sure!!", 
            "Fernando is by far the best math instructor I have ever had. He is super committed and clear. I learned more than I thought humanly possible in one semester. If you can, definitely get his section.", 
            "Fernando is a great teacher. Really takes time explaining things and makes sure everyone understands. Very helpful in answering questions both during and outside of class. Highly recommend taking his class and I hope I can get him as a professor again!", 
            "Fernando is an amazing professor. He really took the time to explain things to you, even if he was past his office hours or class time. He is very approachable and a wonderful teacher. Take him if you can!!", 
            "Amazing professor. Very approachable and is always willing to meet outside of class. The exams are definitely tough but he makes them so that's a plus. He explains things very well and hands out a lot of worksheets/gives practice problems for most of the sections.", 
            "The best professor I have had at UMichigan thus far. He really cares whether or not you understand the material. Lectures are easy to follow, keep you interested, and really prepare you for the exams. He is always more than willing to meet with you outside of class whenever it is convenient for you. Definitely try to get his section if you can!", 
            "Best teacher in UMichigan!", 
            "AMAZING professor! He makes the exams so its very helpful. Pretty sure he is one of the only calc2 teachers that actually lectures and he is very good at it. He makes sure every student understands. He is extremely approachable and will do ANYTHING to help his students. Always willing to meet outside of class. He makes class easy to attend."

She is on of the nicest lecturers you could hope for; at least she cares about how well her students do. Perhaps she makes a few mistakes but it doesn't take more than a shred of sense to realise. Any capable student shouldn't mind her.",

            "Do not take her as your professor. She is awful. There is nothing that I can say nice about her, besides she was alwasy late, and therefore allowed us to have plently of time before class to talk about how much we disliked her.", 
            "Wow..., what a terrible professor. She is constantly late to class and says \"I wasn't feeling well,\" \"I'm on my period.\" She actually managed to show up to an exam 35 minutes late. She should be fired.", 
            "She lacks teaching skills. I didn't learn anything from her lecture. However, her course is easy to get A.",

            "As said, she struggles with in-class examples, further confusing students. She is very unprofessional. I never even received a syllabus from her. Probably about 45% of the time she came to class and said she was sick and wouldn't be able to lecture. More than 5 mintues late to class every day. Does provide many office hours and reviewsessions.",

Here's a summary on Dean's abilities: If we ask questions in class, she cannot answer any hard questions and some basic ones and ask students what they did...",

Her exams are beyond what she covers in class by far. She is also terrible with dates and homework. She cancels class and office hours yet expects you to know the material."

            "He seems boring at first, but stick with him, because he is an excellent lecturer. He is very clear and easy to follow and works to answer any questions people have in lectures/discussions. He has a very corny sense of humor at times, but it does serve to maintain attention in lecture. His only problem was that he taught the 9 am lecture.", 
            "Very nice man, but lectures are a waste of time. NO problem solving examples or techniques are presented. Very slow speaker. Exams are MUCH more difficult than material in mast. phys. and practice exams. VERY time consuming: I read all chapters, att. all lec. and disc. sections and study group to get a lousy A-. Do not take with dbl honors orgo!", 
            "PROS: + knows material + presents all the demos and info you need to know. CONS: - extremely difficult to stay awake in his class - material is difficult MIXED: +- has humor but its too dry to keep you awake.",

            "Gidley rocks. His dry sense of humor adds a pizazz his otherwise dull lectures . Also during quizdom questions he will give you the answer half of the time so if you don't need to pay attention. All in all David Gidley is the man.", 
            "He does make stupid jokes every now and then, but he actually teaches the material clearly. However, I find him not too useful if you ask him questions in person. I tried doing so once, and he seemed impatient.", 
            "A little on the boring side, but he does a great job presenting all the material in clear powerpoints. He is almost always available to help you out with homework. If you pay attention and do the homework, the tests are really easy to get A's on.", 
            "Not very clear at all. Some exam questions difficult because of their wording. Repetitive with a very monotone voice, but if you can decipher his rambling and put together the important parts of lecture you're good.", 
            "Not bad. Covered the material pretty well. Straightforward teaching style. Can't complain for a giant intro lecture. Homeworks were canned textbook problems. Test problems were a little challenging; I'd say on par with PHYS 140 tests. Should have told other students to shut the hell up during lectures so those who wanted to learn could have.",

So if the student pays attention, getting an A is very possible. This class is not easy, but as long as you pay attention, you will do better than 50% of freshmen who are attending this class as well.",

He allows you to do a re-take on the first two exams and early back half your points. Do the masteries EARLY because it's 30% of your grade and easy to get done.",

Do the 15 masteries as early as possible and really try hard to create good examples the first time so he will accept a mastery the first time. One of the only classes here that I can say I was truly engaged and will retain the learning. Easy A.", 
            "Dr. Rothman is a very straightforward individual. The key to success in any class is to ALWAYS take good notes, even if you understood the material the first time around. Remember, you are a kinesthetic learner. Jot as much information down as you can so you do not have to study too much for the day of the test. Standing ovations everywhere.", 
            "Whoever says this class is hard never listens in lecture. Everything is about understanding, how could you learn STATS without knowing the theory behind it? A lot of people say this class isn't like a stats class because there are not many quantitive staff and calculations. He is very helpful and knowledgeable, and clearly explained everything.", 
            "This is probably the most useless stats classes I've ever taken - I don't even feel like I'm learning stats but rather theories and principles about life. It is an easy A if you pay attention but the prof rambles a lot and can be pretty confusing. I also hate how condescending he acts sometimes.",

            "Rothman is incredibly smart and passionate about what he teaches. It's not a difficult class if you pay attention in lecture, and GET YOUR MASTERIES APPROVED ASAP. He's generous in that he allows retakes for every exam, and he doesn't make grading competitive. Definitely one of the better Applied Stats courses out there.", 
            "This is an easy class and he is an inspiring teacher. His rants are usually entertaining and funny. You need to attend ALL the classes to answer test questions because the grading keys for the tests are horribly specific. I blame a mix of his poorly written test keys and weak-willed GSIs. Masteries? Just do them. 2 paragraphs 15 is not hard.", 
            "WORST CLASS. TOTALLY USELESS. The professor Does nothing. He just mentions one or two models and somehow it is going to be students' job to cover all the theories about that. 3 group projects and 2 exams and homework every week, which are not related to what he says in the class at all. DO NOT TAKE IT if you can.", 
            "The class materials are fine but the professor is a tough person. He never makes the standards for those \"masteries\" clear and forces students to go to his office hours. Lectures are unclear and unorganized , the lecture powerpoints are of the worst quality I have ever seen. Worst stats professor, I'll never take any class from him.",

Extremely helpful in office hours. Make sure you DO NOT procrastinate when it comes to the mastery reports. Great Class to take and very knowledgeable",

Don't expect to see him outside of office hours though! I had lectures so sent three emails and they were all ignored. Getting masteries approved was impossible.", 
            "I thought this class was extremely easy. Not sure why people are hating on Rothman. The masteries are 2 paragraphs and a related article each and you have the whole semester to do them all. not a big deal at all. Teaches this class like a management course in the business world", 
            "Honestly, the worst statistics class I have ever taken here. This class is easy but do not take it. It is a waste of time. Ed Rothman is an old, grumpy man hellbent on spreading his own stupid life lessons. Too much tedious work (read about the masteries from other people) and you have to literally memorize everything like he tells you. Ridiculous.", 
            "Rothman forces students to show up to office hours for masteries. If you can't make office hours because a class conflict tough luck because he won't accomodate. Also if you have a question, such as, \"when is the final?\" He'll tell you to look it up. Goes on random tangents in class. Overall not a difficult course, just lacks any organization.", 
            "The most disorganized class I have taken at U of M. Mandates these assignments called Masteries that need to be approved by him in office hours and if you can't make his office hours then goodbye to your grade. Very condescending and goes on tireless rants",

He makes his own homework/exams so it's hard to reference any answers or try to use examples in the book. The book is not helpful by the way since he teaches material outside of it.

I'd definitely take another course with him.",

Generous curve; allows you to worry about learning the material and not so much about the number of points you have in the class.",

He teaches deeper material than required. He pushed his students hard. But if you don't like physics that much you probably will be annoyed by his everyday homework. But I loved it!",

There were homework sets due almost every single day, and the homework was very difficult. He spends too much time deriving equations and not enough on physical applications. He expected math up through diff eq & linear.",

Discussion is extremely helpful and exams aren't too hard.",

Quizdom questions often have no relevance to that particular lecture, and are rarely explained afterwards. Makes students feel stupid for asking questions, either one on one or in lecture. Try to take this class with a different professor.",

Worth taking if the class is a one-time requirement.",

            "Ann was a sweet woman with interesting lectures. However, most of the material in lecture was not on the test, nor was the material in the book. To get an A, you need a good GSI and to go to ANN's office hours, not your GSI's...because she writes the tests. And let me tell you, I was surprised by the level of ambiguity on her tests.", 
            "Her level of interest in psychology shines through in her lectures. Although she does not necessarily direct her topics of discussion towards test material, she has a lot of very interesting things to say about psychology. I would recommend her, you will learn a lot from this class even though it is pretty easy. It is worth going to lecture.", 
            "Ann Phillips was very helpful. I learned a lot from her lectures. At first she was kind of boring but her lectures get better every time. I found myself interested in what she was saying one day. Anyways, easy A. I never read (EVER!), and missed 3 lectures and still got a B+. So if you need an interesting class to relax in, take this one!", 
            "The easiest class I have taken at this whole school. Her lectures are boring but bearable, she shows a lot of videos clips which make it a little more interesting.", 
            "Very easy class. I attended two of her lectures this period and still got an A. Either way, you will have to read the text to do well in the class, so her lectures are unnecessary. She posts the slides to the lectures every week, so before the test, look over the slides and you'll be fine.", 
            "I liked this class. Many of the past comments seem outdated because I think she's made some changes. Class was pretty easy but interesting if you haven't had psychology yet. All I did was go to lecture and discussion and study the vocabulary from the textbook and I could've got 100% if I had done the extra credit that was available.", 
            "fair class -- interesting and you will do well if you do the reading. i liked the lectures but they are not necessary. if you don't go to the lectures though make sure you study the slides", 
            "I know many didn't like her lectures, but I did. She mostly taught from the book however. It is a pretty easy class and ther research paper is soooo easy.", 
            "honestly no need to EVER go to lecture. however make sure you are keeping up and study. i barely studied before the first midterm and did badly, though the class average was high. just make sure you read the modules before discussion and study for the exams and youll be totally fine. super easy. research paper is a joke", 
            "Ok Professor. Nice but useless lectures. She connects every psychological theory to her own life even if it doesn't make any sense. Easy class though", 
            "Eh... she's pretty average. Either attend lecture or read the book, there's really no need to do both.", 
            "Horrible Lecturer, you don't even need to go to lecture if you just read the book. Easy multiple choice tests, but the writing portion was graded harshly! If you want to do a lot of reading, this is the class for you!", 
            "Lectures weren't very useful to me, so I stopped going, but she is really nice and willing to meet outside of class to speak with you. This class all depends on who you get as a GSI. I recommend Jay Holden, he's awesome. As for the exams, just read the textbook, and you'll be fine. It also helps if you email her, go to \"coffee talk.\"", 
            "She's very nice and helpful. Her lectures are a little boring, be sure you don't take it early in the morning! It's obvious she knows a lot about her subject and enjoys teaching. The exams, however, are pretty difficult. There are LOTS of tricky questions-be sure to study!", 
            "Just go to office hours...this class is an easy A if you go to office hours and talk about the material with her....she is really nice and interesting.", 
            "She's pretty useless in class. Her lecture slides usually range about 10 to 15. She lets us out early alot. Just read the goddamn book and you'll be able to teach better than her. Oh, and all the \"really helpful\" lectures like right before the exams.. not really necessary to attend. She's nice, but not the greatest prof.", 
            "Definitely not necessary to go to class. Just read the book and understand all the main terms and you'll be good. She's crazy", 
            "Booorrrrrriiiinnnnngggg", 
            "really nice--seems to really enjoy getting to know students. lectures are not essential because the exams are entirely based off the book. through going to office hours, i was able to see that shes a lot smarter than she presents herself in lecture. wayyy better than malley--i switched out of his class.", 
            "The class isn't super easy nor super hard. I didn't go to any of the lectures the second half of the semester and did fine. Just go to discussion and read the book."

            "Caldwell is a good teacher. However, 90% of your grade will be exams and if you slip up once you're not getting an A. He also has an ego that personally irked me a bit. Overall it's a fine class but know what you're getting into.", 
            "Limited room for error but I covered more content in my high school econ class", 
            "Lectures were kinda confusing - added stuff in slides that wasn't necessary and led me away from main points. People seemed to like him, but I didn't really love him. Tests are hard (harder than other teachers' I believe), especially since I had never taken AP Micro/Macro or any other Econ class before. Go to lecture and do practice HW to do well!", 
            "Caldwell was a great teacher. He presented the material well and with numerous examples. His tests can be tricky, but if you slow down and break the problem apart, then it is pretty easy to deduce the correct answer. If you took AP Microeconomics in high school and did well, then this class should essentially be review for you.", 
            "I came in thinking it was going to be a bad class but i actually did very well because he is very clear in lectures. Office hours are approachable but go early because it lots of people go the week before exams. Definitely go to lectures and you will learn a lot. 10 out of 10 recommend.", 
            "Caldwell was an amazing teacher. He understands that some topics are confusing and really simplifies them. He is easily accessible and such a cool guy. I do think that it is not an easy course without effort but if you put in the work you should get an A. Id reccomend going to office hours and looking through past exams to do well", 
            "Caldwell was a sufficient teacher but his exams are really difficult and count way too much for part of your grade. There's not much you can do if you get a bad exam score on any of the three exams that count for 90% of your grade. Each test question is 1% of your final grade. He's a good professor, but if you want an easier A, take Dudley's class.", 
            "Great lecturer and very helpful. Tests not very difficult.", 
            "Caldwell is a great teacher who makes an effort to get to know the students that take his class seriously. He explains topics clearly, and although one of the harder Econ101 classes, it is the best class I have taken at Michigan to date. The exams are only difficult because of the multiple choice format, and if you know the concepts, you'll do well", 
            "The class itself isn't hard, but it's easy to get complacent about it. Don't skip lectures, go to section the week before quizzes, go over the practice problems the curve is friendly, but every point does matter in this course when it comes to grading.", 
            "If you have never taken Economics before, then Dr. Ron is your man. He explains the concepts of microeconomics in a very intuitive manner. Go to lectures and you spare yourself tons of headache reading through dry text. Prepare hard for the exams as they are very tricky. Do the practice problems as many of them appear on the exams.", 
            "Caldwell is a great teacher who really knows his material. He's very passionate about his subject and tries to make lectures as entertaining as possible. However, he makes tests very hard, hypes up his curve, and his lectures are so long. The quizzes are easy 10's, and there is no final exam. I would not take Caldwell. Other teachers are easier.", 
            "Great teacher. To do well do as many practice tests as you can. It is wroth it to go to lecture but I never went to the discussion sections. I took AP in high school but still had to study. Got an A on 2 exams and B+ on the other. Make sure you get all the points from the quizzes.", 
            "Honestly, the class is easy. His final is hard so make sure to study. However, he makes a huge curve for the class. You get in what you put out with him. He really cares about making the students understand the material and I appreciated that.", 
            "Everyone says he's the best econ teacher at this university, but not sure if that's true. He isn't really able to explain concepts well if you've never taken econ before and acts as if it comes intuitively to everyone. Tests are extremely hard and you must study hard in order to do well.", 
            "Dr. Caldwell is a great professor who really cares about his students. The exams were definitely tough and he emphasizes understanding the material over memorization. Review lectures, do the problem sets and practice exam, and you will be fine. I learned a ton and am really happy I took this course for intellectual breadth in engineering.", 
            "Entertaining, but wouldn't necessarily say helpful. Tests are hard, limited room for error", 
            "Caldwell is so funny, He really seems to care about his students, The class is light actual workload, but you really have to stay on top of the concepts and have a complete understanding of them for the exams. if you sit in the first few rows you can he'll interact with you and keep you on track. Go to office hours they help a good amount.", 
            "Dr. Caldwell is an amazing professor. He gave every student in his 800+ Econ 101 class a thorough introduction to Economics. Though there were only three midterms and five quizzes (each midterm is 30% of your grade, each quiz is 2%) and my grade was based almost solely on the midterms I took (which are tricky), I really learned a lot. Great class.", 
            "So I literally just finished caldwells third midterm and can officially say he is amazing. He is the best prof at Michigan. If you sit in the front feel rows and participate he will use your name in examples and it makes a lot easier to pay attention. Exams are fair. The Gsis suck at least mine did. Try to go go to Luis or Thomas dis. In w2017"

            "Sooooo much busy work but it is effective in improving your Spanish skills. I think he grades easier or harder depending on whether or not he likes you, so if you participate a lot in class you will do better.", 
            "I took 230 and although it was 2 hours for 4 days a week, it was actually enjoyable. Juan loves his job and makes things fun while you learn. I loved him! And he really cares about you and your grade. He makes an effort to know all of his students. I would definitely recommend this class just because of him.", 
            "A really great professor, he truly cares about his students and making sure they are understanding and getting the most from the course. I would highly recommend taking his course if you have the opportunity.", 
            "A wonderful teacher. He comes everyday wanting to help you. Loves it when you participate no matter your skill or even if you get every answer wrong. An absolutely great guy with plenty of experience. I highly recommend his History of Spain through Music and Cinema.", 
            "Carlos really wants you to participate in class, but you don't have to be perfect. He grades pretty easily and the tests barely require any serious studying. He can be moody but most of the time he's really nice and funny. If you go to class and pay attention you can easily get an A. Just don't use your phone in class!", 
            "Carlos is a good teacher, but he expects a lot of participation and doesn't just do \"completion\" grades for homework. Don't take this class if you want an easy A. That being said, he isn't tough either... He's a pretty \"middle of the road\" kind of prof. You still definitely learn a lot.", 
            "I loved Carlos' class as a Spanish course. Carlos was an amazing teacher who understood when our class was having problems with a specific section. Instead of rushing through it, Carlos would thoroughly focus on this area and clear any troubles we had. As long as you talk in Spanish and participate to the best of your ability you will be fine.", 
            "I only took this class because I had to finish my Spanish requirement but I ended up loving it! Carlos is a really nice guy and a pretty easy grader. If you do your homework and participate in class you will do very well. The tests are really easy too! (no more than an hour of studying necessary)", 
            "This guy is not afraid to call you out so don't whip out your phone or talk out of turn. He may be a bit intimidating at times and doesn't seem interested in being there, but his class was pretty easy. He's a nice guy and funny. Movies are also pretty interesting too. I'd recommend the class.", 
            "Great teacher. He cares deeply about his students and how they do in the class. Go to class and do the homework and you should be fine. Overall the most caring professor I've had.", 
            "I was pleasantly surprised by this class. Carlos challenges us to learn as much as we can, but he keeps it interesting and is a funny guy, I took this only because I had to but had a pleasant experience at the end. Just make sure that you go to class and do all the assigned work. The tests are not terrible, but preparation is necessary.", 
            "One of the worst experiences I've ever had in a Spanish class. He would cancel his office hours (which were right before class) without telling us, major quizzes and papers were due on the same days with little clarification. He always seemed annoyed by students and the class had no cohesion whatsoever. A lot of kids dropped the class.", 
            "Had Carlos for 2 semesters, he was always willing to meet for office hours, passionate about what he does and always willing to help if you put in effort. Overall great teacher and reason why I'm still taking Spanish", 
            "Muy guapo. Class was pretty boring however, and he would get really mad if people didnt participate. The class itself is not fun because it is all about historical events in spanish speaking countries, but he tries his best to make it interesting. Directions are not very clear and often hard to follow.", 
            "No Comments",

            "Carlos is super, super nice and extremely helpful during office hours. Homework every day and toward the end of the semester there is a lot of it. The exams are pretty easy and he always puts a review up on ctools. Participate a lot and he'll love you!",

Like any science class at UofM it is difficult and you really can only do well if you are willing to put the work in outside of class. Dus will definitely help you but you need to approach her for help.", 
            "Monica taught the second half of the class and her half , while still requiring considerable work, was a lot better. Her exams were very fair. She sometimes would test on very specific things you wouldn't think to memorize but if you're ever in doubt, just ask. Overall,She genuinely cares about her students. P.S. there's a secret curve.", 
            "Monica is a genuinely kind professor who really cares about her students. She does review before every exam, and is really helpful in office hours if you take the time to go. Genetics is hard but her half of the class was very fair in my opinion. I would take a class with her again for sure", 
            "Here's the thing: Monica is actually super sweet, cares about her students, and tries really hard to improve her teaching style based on feedback. All of the other genetics professors are sub par, so in comparison, she's pretty good. She's just kind of unorganized and not very clear about what she wants us to know for exams.", 
            "Dus seems fine so far. Unlike most professors, you can tell she genuinely cares.", 
            "Monica was the best professor I've had at Michigan. When I took the class with her I too was mad at her, but she prepared me better than anyone else for upper level classes and the MCAT. She literally percolates knowledge even when she describes the most mundane things. Only later will does one see the great effects of taking a class with Dus.", 
            "I liked Dr. Dus, but one of the problems was that she spent too much time discussing irrelevant questions from students and getting off-topic. At times, the lecture felt like free-flowing conversation between her and one or two students. Because of this, we would often run out of time to cover all of the slides.", 
            "Professor Dus is a really great and nice person, however her teaching ability leaves a lot to be desired. She treats students as if they are PhD students, as in she assumes we know a lot of what she is talking about, when this is most of the time untrue. However, she is very accessible and is willing to answer questions. Just be prepared to work", 
            "The final exam was unreasonably difficult with an average of 68% after accepting multiple answers on 3 of the 30 questions. Lectures were not adequate for preparing for exams and neither was the book.", 
            "I find it amusing how people think they would've done better with a different professor. The grade distribution will end up being the exact same regardless of who teaches it. That being said, Monica's exam demands strong analytical skills, you can't just memorize all the lectures. That could be good or bad depending on who you are.", 
            "New professor, so has little experience teaching, and it shows. Very research focused, and she always seems tempted to talk about and test you on her research. Goes through lectures pretty fast, and covers topics in less detail then they will be on the exam, which is annoying. Definitely recommend the book to learn material fully.", 
            "Professor Dus was extremely helpful and caring. She went above and beyond when it came to helping students via email, in office hours, and in class. She was very clear in class and made complicated topics simple. All of the papers we read were cutting edge. This class was the best class I've taken so far at this university, mostly due to Dr. Dus!", 
            "Professor Dus is receiving too much criticism. Her exams are brutal, but they're still fair. To get an A, you'd have to rewatch her lectures around three times to fully understand the concepts, but honestly this class is just about putting in the time and effort. You won't be spoon-fed information, but you will learn a lot if you just try.", 
            "I respect and enjoy hard classes but this was ridiculous.I worked so hard to try to teach myself this material and learn it back to front and still did not do well in the class. This professor was terrible at explaining the material and her exams were too hard for how poorly she taught the class. You will never be prepared for the exams she gives.", 
            "I liked Monica as a person, but I wouldn't take a class with her again. The exams (particularly the final) focused on only a few difficult topics, topics that weren't heavily emphasized in classes. You can do the readings, re-watch the lectures, and do the practice problems, but you really have NO way of knowing if you'll be ready for exams.", 
            "Dr. Dus is a very passionate professor who works very hard to teach an obviously difficult class. Her slides and figures were confusing, but she is very clear in her explanations in office hours. The exams were challenging, but why would genetics be easy. Also being her first time teaching Bio305, I would only expect her to get better over time.", 
            "Coming from someone who most likely failed both of her exams, this was easily the best experience I've had a Michigan. People will complain because they did poorly or because they weren't spoon fed the information like the teachers here tend to do. If you actually want to learn something and push yourself this is the right class. Cheers to Dus.", 
            "Dr. Dus is incredibly knowledgeable on the subject matter of genetics, she is very available for office hours and responds to emails quickly. However, lecture slides were very unclear about tested material. We were required to know the minutiae of some material and almost nothing about other topics despite both being on the slides.", 
            "Teacher's tend to struggle when teaching a class for the first time, but Dus did more than others. Her last exam was expected to cover 7 lectures but only touched on very specific details of 3. The grades do not represent how well students know the overall material, only if they can recall specific details she only spent seconds going over", 
            "So it's quite obvious that down below we have someone who didn't do well and resorts to being a whiny pre-med over it. Grow up. I actually didn't do so well in the class, but I can respect Dr. Dus since she really does try her best. I mean she is really new as a professor and I'm sure she'll get better over the years. Really nice and genuine"

She always makes herself available through e-mail, office hours, and appointments, too. My writing improved dramatically because of her class.", 
            "Alisse is a terrific professor. She is helpful, kind, and really cares about the well-being of students. I strongly recommend her class!", 
            "Alisse was very frustrating to work with. She doesn't want to help improve your writing. She wants to help the already good writers write even better, leaving the rest of us behind. I tried to meet with her outside of her office hours (because I worked) but she was unwilling to do so.", 
            "I learned a lot from this class. However, Alisse will not listen to you, help you, meet with you, etc. She won't go the extra mile for her students, and I think she lacks a desire to nurture progress. She'll tell you that you're wrong, but she won't help you find the right way. I just felt intimidated and boxed in. Though, again, I learned a lot.", 
            "Great intro to lit studies class! Have to read all the books very carefully and in their entirety but what else can you expect from an English class? Discussions are always great. She focuses on building \"habits of mind\" that I truly believe will help me in all future classes. Great prof, great class, highly recommended.", 
            "In a class about social justice, Alisse created an environment of oppression, where people were called out for saying anything she construed as politically incorrect to the point that people were scared to speak. Not much learning going on in that type of environment.", 
            "This is a really great class to fulfill the Race/Ethnicity requirement or to take for the english major. Although I didn't always like the reading for this class, I felt as if the readings chosen had a lot of variety. I grew as a reader and a person from taking this class because I began to think about issues in a new way.", 
            "Great class with a lot of interesting readings and challenging conversations. She does like to hear herself talk sometimes, still she's very open to learning from her students. She will challenge you to question your opinions and how you came to form them. I grew a lot as a reader and a person from taking her class.", 
            "Alisse is an exceptional teacher, and English 319 is an exceptional class. Have an open mind, and it can change your worldview entirely.", 
            "I really enjoyed this class. You read some great books and there was potential for some great discussion; the class size was just a little too big. I think they're reducing it for next time. Alisse is a great teacher; just needs to learn how to educate without coming across as quite so intimidating. She doesn't have ill intentions, though.", 
            "If you do the readings and go to class & participate, this class can be amazing! The reading material is engaging & interesting. I actually wish I could major in Rhetoric after taking this class. I definitely recommend it!",

Do yourself a favor and try to register for 215. It lay be a little tougher, bu tat least you can walk away saying you learned something, unlike me.", 
            "He is a nice professor but this class is ridiculous. There is a bunch of busy work due every week but most of the material is stuff you don't cover in class so it is typically very frustrating. The class is easy to maintain an A in due to all the extra credit available but you don't get much more besides that out of it.", 
            "Ganago is literally the worst professor I've ever had. The only reason I went to lectures were for I clicker questions which were participation based. He likes to use stories extensively however some of them contained very sexist language. Easy A if you do the homework though. If you don't understand him in lecture you won't understand his book", 
            "Not as bad as some people say. He's a nice guy, but his lectures can be long. Always has some story/analogy to tell which can be interesting at times and he really seems to care about his students. Tries to give real world examples/applications of class concepts. Textbook/lab manual can be too detailed, but he offers summary handouts for material.", 
            "Absolute worst professor I have ever had. Ganago is a raving lunatic. However, there is so much extra credit that if you don't get an A or A+ you are doing something wrong. I actually did work during the year so that I could have gotten a zero on the final and still gotten an A. There is iClicker during lecture which is the only reason anyone came.", 
            "Big work load but the material isn't difficult. A lot of extra credit opportunities so it is easy to get the grade you want. Lectures aren't really useful apart for the fact that he uses iClickers that count towards your grade. He tends to ramble a lot.", 
            "you won't learn much, but will get an A. So much extra credit is offered that if you don't get an A you really tried not to. Ganago genuinely cares that you learn, but does a bad job of showing it. He is a great guy and wants everyone to get an A, can't really talk bad about him. If you actually want to learn about circuits/more work, take 215.", 
            "Ganago's a nice guy, and he's a decent teacher. The real issue is that he usually talks about stuff that's completely unrelated to what he was lecturing on five minutes prior. The homework takes like 3-4 hours a week, but it's usually on topics not covered in class. That said, there's a lot of extra credit-the average grade was a 92 (an A).", 
            "I'm currently sitting in lecture wondering why I am here? They are completely useless. He doesn't respond to emails and he thinks he answers questions because he cuts off students mid sentence and then answers nothing related to the question. Nice guy, but useless. Everything is uploaded late. labs, hwk, prelabs, self assessments,etc so get excited", 
            "Take this class! It will definitely take some time out your week, but you'll get an A+ out of it! Take it with a friend because you do not want to be working on those assignments alone. Also, you need to be in class to use the i-clicker to show participation for the lecture. And expect to learn everything from the coursepack.",

Be prepared for 10+ hoursweek doing reading, the homework, multiple test centers, a pre lab, a post lab, etc. Overall a horrible way to learn circuits, but it is pretty easy to do well.",

It's a struggle to sit through the 90-minute lecture, which is why most people don't. That said, this class is an easy A.", 
            "Ganago is that grandpa that wants to teach you but can't fully articulate a complete sentence anymore. He will email you 3-4 emails a day talking about his emails he sent you the day before. Lectures are useless unless you need to catch up on sleep. It's an easy A if you put in the work outside of class. He is a horrible professor, good luck", 
            "Everything you need is in the readings he posts. If you don't get an A or A+ in this class, someone should hit you on the head with a tack hammer. The homework and labs are extremely tedious and a waste of time, but are extremely easy.",

Don't go to class, just read the handouts online and turn the homework early for extra credit and you'll do fine.

            "Steven is a really good professor. He's on point about everything. Cut clear in lecture, nice to talk to out of lectures. I think he really cares about being a good teacher.", 
            "Clark isn't the best, but how you do in this class isn't dependent on the professors. Memorize every word of the notes and you are golden. Do not read the book, it is a waste of time. Show up to the necessary amount of lectures to get full points, take a few notes (not 100% necessary), then cram in the 48 hours before the exam.", 
            "Prof. Clark is very smart, and he really knows his stuff, however, he goes over huge topics too quickly and unless you pay very close attention or re-watch the lectures you will not be prepared for his exam questions. He asks extremely detailed questions and tries to trick you on most of the questions so make sure you know EVERYTHING.", 
            "Clark's good during lecture! He's much less monotone than people claim. It's outside of lecture where I have a problem. He's very rude to students asking concept questions on piazza. He'll answer with things like \"that's a good question\" and \"rewatch the last three lectures.\" He's very unapproachable during office hours. And, his exams are harder.", 
            "Clark was not a very good professor, very monotone and doesnt explain stuff in a way that is easy to understand. His exams contain information not in the lecture notes so it can be hard to do well.", 
            "I cut Dr. Clark some slack: he has to teach very conceptually challenging concepts. With that being said, Dr. Clark struggles to provide the basic framework to understand these difficult concepts. He's obviously very knowledgable but he goes way too quickly through lectures without reinforcing much of the material.", 
            "Don't understand the hatred. Not a super easy class but possible to get somewhere in A range, especially with curve. Go to lecture and discussion for easy points. Rewatch the lectures the day of and continually go over lecture notes and eventually you'll get the concepts and won't need to look over older Powerpoints anymore. Join an SLC group.",

            "I don't understand why he has such low ratings. In my opinion, Clark is a great teacher who does a great job of explaining difficult concepts clearly. Yeah the average on exam 3 was a 68 but apparently the high population of freshman and greeks in this class makes students unable to understand what a curve means.",

My boy Steve will constantly preach about how you have to focus more on applying concepts rather than memorizing stuff. Just memorize all of the stuffs. Everything is from lecture slides and discussion. Know it all and enjoy your A.",

He runs through huge concepts and honestly makes no sense. The average on his exam was a 68! A 68! Unheard of in an intro class. Just to top it all off, he didn't get an ovation on the last day of class. Avoid. AVOID.",

But he was excellent on cutting complicated problems into basic concepts, and it makes things easier. His lecture was worth attending. Plus you can always get some cheap jokes on snowmen.", 
            "He spends more time trying to actually teach the material rather than trying to jump into examples as soon as possible. He assigns grades more generously than some of the other professors.", 
            "Although he seems to be very intelligent, he tends to fall behind on material. It's hard to collaborate reading the book and his class because he's rarely on the material you thought he was covering that day. Goes over all the material the same amount, which is good and bad considering he focuses too much on the easily understood but not the hard.", 
            "Very smart person, really cares about his students and grades generously. would highly recommend him for any class", 
            "I agree that he doesn't spend enough time on the harder concepts, but I think it must be a hard class to teach b/c some ppl in the class don't understand basic skills (ex how to take derivatives) and don't read the book so if he goes faster they'll be lost. He is very patient, and doesn't make you feel stupid no matter what question you ask.", 
            "Here's the run down on Harry: He's a nice guy who clearly is extrememly intelligent. That being said, he spends too much time on the basics, not enough on more challenging aspects of a topic, and often spends 15 minutes of class reiterating some basic topics from the previous lecture. He means well, but I, personally, am not a fan."

He does offer a lot of extra credit so it's an easy A... my grade moved from a B to an A when he put the extra credit in at the end of the semester.", 
            "I really enjoyed Prof Ybarra. He is really passionate about the subject and tries to bring in a bunch of modern examples to connect the material. He does give occasional quizzes, but will always let you know a week ahead of time and they're not that difficult. No tests, just a few papers that were fairly easy to write. Definitely a great class!", 
            "My guy Mike is a real hoot. Yeah, you've gotta read to pass the in-class quizzes, but the class isn't too bad. Turn things in on time and show up to class for the occasional extra credit and you're golden.", 
            "Here's all you need to know. No exams. GSIs matter so hopefully you get a good one. Come to class he offers lots of extra credit just for showing up. Quizzes are hardest part of the class. Lots of reading but you really only have to do the ones at the beginning of the semester. Work decently hard on the papers and you'll be fine. Easy A.", 
            "Ybarra is a nice professor, he tries to help students with extra credits and the selection of reading material was interesting. However, the lectures are terribly boring and students often get lost in the explanations.", 
            "Prof Ybarra is a really nice guy, tries his best to keep lectures interesting. Offers tons of in-class extra credit for just coming to class, highly recommend going. No tests, just \"pop-quizzes\" (he gives you advance notice) and papers. Definitely an easy A, pretty interesting material as well", 
            "Ybarra is a nice guy, but his lectures aren't focused and drift all over the place. However, I do recommend showing up to class because there is a ton of in-class extra credit that will boost your grade substantially. There were 6 total essays plus weekly Journal assignments, and A LOT of readings that you should prob just skim", 
            "Overall an easy class. You get a lot of extra credit for being in class. The reading is heavy, but since the writing is argument based you do not have to dive deeply into all the issues. Quizzes are easy if you take notes and just skim the readings. Definitely would take this class again! Just stay on top of the readings.", 
            "Nice guy, the lectures are long. The readings are cool and the papers are a good length. Interesting topic.", 
            "lectures are soooo drawn out a boring. He moves through slides extremely slowly and rambles on a lot. Easy class though with a lot of extra credit and hand-holding for assignments. Attendance not necessary except for the occasional in-class quiz.", 
            "Ybarra was awesome. Though his lectures were boring, if you are looking for an easy A, TAKE HIS CLASS. As long as you do the study guide, you will be fine on quizzes and exams. A ton of extra credit as well that will boost your grade.", 
            "Sports and Society. Very interesting class if you like sports, extremely easy A. Quizzes, exams, and papers but everything is laid out for you so it is very easy to do well. So much extra credit it's comical. Ybarra is the man.", 
            "Ybarra's lectures are very interesting but the class is extremely easy. You can not do a single reading all semester as and as long as you show up to discussion and do the study guides for quizzes and exams you should easily get an A. One of the easier classes at this school.", 
            "this is by far one of the worst classes I have ever taken. the teacher makes you memorize worthless facts for tests and makes it extremely confusing to know what to study for. he assigns 100 page readings for every class period and the readings are extremely redundant and not related to the class. he literally reads off his slides in class . he is", 
            "Ybarra may be knowledgeable, but he is not as funny as he thinks he is, and expects way too much from his students. He will assign 50-100 pages of reading a class and expects students to know every word of the work. His explanations of concepts are confusing and is deathly boring to listen to.", 
            "4 words: easy peasy lemon squeezy. Don't go to class you're wasting time he posts his notes. Just participate once/discussion, do at least some of the extra credit, and answer the study guides before the quiz. When you do the essay, toss in a couple quotes, they love it.", 
            "Professor Ybarra is great. His lectures seem long, but I would take his SOC 295 class again. He sometimes brings in cool speakers and shows videos which are interesting. Great guy.", 
            "Soc 102 was a class on sports and I love sports, but Ybarra made it boring. Also, considering the topics revolved around sports, I don't think the class helped me get a good education into introductory sociology.", 
            "Great guy. Great course. Lots of reading, but interesting reading. Would recommend", 
            "SOC 102 with Professor Ybarra is an easy class. More than half of the class got an A. Lectures are pretty boring; would recommend splitting up lectures with friends to get notes. Discussion is mandatory. Lecture Slides are rarely posted online. You can boost your grade over 10% with extra credit. Quizzes have clear cut study guides."

Class is mostly just talking in Italian with prompts, and I find this extremely more useful than language teachers that just reiterate the textbook almost like a math class. Gu is absolutely hilarious and does not pick favorites like some of these reviews say", 
            "Gugu is an amazing teacher! I had him for both Italian 231 and 232. Italian is a difficult language, but he does an amazing job teaching. He also has lots of office hours and enjoys chatting with students outside of class. His lectures are also hilarious, and he makes participating easy. I'm so glad I had him as a teacher! -Marielle", 
            "He is the best. Great best friend, always has suggestions to jump out the window. Tough, T-O-U-G-H grader. That il supposed to be la? 3 points off. Misspelled the word? kiss that A goodbye. Overall GUGU is hilarious and you will laugh and have fun in class but you must work hard to get a B . Also he will attack you with italian outside of class.", 
            "All the italian professors are generally easy-going, and Gugu fits right in. It was a fun class to be in. I can see how he would be a poor professor for someone who has to put in a lot of effort to learn, but I found no problems with him personally.", 
            "Very funny professor. The class is fairly easy as long as you take/study notes. He highly encourages vocal practice which is great. The only problem I had was that half the time, I couldn't even understand what he was saying. His accent is just thick enough to where you have to really pay attention to what he means, or else you will get lost.", 
            "Gugu is a boss!", 
            "He is a great teacher. Gugu taught the material in a way that was easy to follow. If there is anything you want to improve on, he'll give you suggestions of what to practice. Office hours were helpful. Homework & tests were reasonable. If you put the effort in & stay on top of the material, you can do really well in this class.", 
            "Yes, gugu is hilarious. Is he a good teacher? no. He is not. He will get mad at you when you dont know the answer to a concept he taught just one second beforehand. He grades the compositions on a bell curve also. It absolutely sucks to be in this class. there arent enough words to explain how much i wish i took another prof.", 
            "He is super funny. He sometimes does not understand you completely in english and he will respond to something completely different but its not too bad. Homework is assigned daily but is not collected (We go over it in class). If you don't turn in something on time he will not get mad and will let you turn it in a few days late.", 
            "Super FUNNY!", 
            "Gugu is great. He's funny, he keeps a lighthearted mood flowing throughout class, and he doesn't get mad if you're late or if you didn't finish your homework. No, he doesn't speak fluent english, but his use of Italian forces you to learn! I love him, and I look forward to his class! Highly recommended.", 
            "class with Prof gugu was great... he was very funny and laid back but taught us a lot at the same time. i highly recommend taking language with him", 
            "Gugu makes extremely inappropriate jokes and frequently insults women, but you just have to laugh it off and roll with it. If you can do that, you'll like him. Homework is easy. You never really know what he's correcting you on, he barely speaks english, and he can't understand your questions, but he does do the best he can to teach you", 
            "Gugu is very entertaining. As long as you participate and joke around with him, you will be on his good side. He is very lenient with homework, but make sure you have some of the answers filled in. I've had him for two semesters, and if you have a good attitude, you'll have fun in class with him.", 
            "Gugu is hilariously sweet, he wears awesome pants, but he's definitely not the MOST amazing teacher. He will either make you love or hate the class depending on if you're on his good side. Homework is graded pretty easily, you don't even have to do all of it. Overall not a bad class though", 
            "I absolutely love Gugu. He is a great professor and very entertaining. If you get on his good side he'll give you good grades. For having the class 4 times a week, it was never a huge burden to go. He's the best. I took him for 101 and 102 because he is awesome.", 
            "Poor and old fashioned teaching methodology, rather repetitive, sometimes his comments can be sarcastic and even (involuntarily, I think)offensive. He maybe funny and hilarious, but there are much better Italian teachers around.", 
            "Gugu is insane. I'm nearly positive he was randomly picked up in Italy somewhere and flown to U of M to teach. He's very chill, and a pretty awesome teacher. Sometimes he would grade random things really harshly, but overall he's a good guy. If you happen to smoke then he'll love you even more.", 
            "Gugu is really really guido. He's a chill guy, good teacher, and very knowledgeable on Italian culture.",

There is a lot of reading, but all you have to do is show up and take notes pretty much. And there are three papers throughout the term.", 
            "So, the class itself is enjoyable. Not the best, but definitely not the worst. However, Prof. Eagle shouldn't be teaching. He never uploads any document to canvas other than the readings, so if you lose the paper topics, good luck. There's no mention of grading on the syllabus, and he recently said if you miss class, you fail. Which is ridiculous.", 
            "If you're into film composition, this is an excellent way to fill your R&E requirement. Dr. Eagle will let you know exactly what he found important in the movies, and how it relates to the essay topics. For the papers, write them in accordance with what is discussed in lecture, and you'll do well. Films DO have graphic content, if that deters you.", 
            "The movies were very dull sometimes, but he goes over the movies thoroughly in class. GO TO CLASS and GO TO THE SCREENINGS. If you don't go, you'll have to do make up work. If you skip the movie, he'll give you a pop quiz about it. He can be very monotonous sometimes, so drink coffee before class if you have to.", 
            "I took this class in the spring and it was a great choice. You show up to class, watch a movie and have him talk at you for the rest of the time while you mess around on your laptop. You do not have to participate, read the readings or care about the subject. Simply take a few notes, and write the most stereotypical paper. It is GSI dependent.", 
            "I like the movies in this course. Professor Eagle knows his content very well!", 
            "As we watch the films for this course in class, attendance is very important. The films are usually very intense or graphic and for this semester there was not a list of triggers present from the films, so I felt a little caught off guard with the problematic films and discussions.", 
            "Professor Eagle is a great and engaging lecturer and I had a blast in his European cinema course. There are lots of readings that you need to understand thoroughly in order to write the papers, but he explains all key concepts really well during lectures. Some say he's a tough grader, but I thought he was very fair in his feedback.", 
            "Herb was a good person overall. That being said the class was a mess. Their was no clear grading system for the GSI's to operate off of. The grading criteria for essays were never shared with us. The organization of the course was terrible and my experience was a reflection of it. The GSI's saved the course.", 
            "Pretty cool class and easier than I thought it would be. Herb was very nice but you really do have to roll with his opinions if you want a good grade in the class. Though in the rewrites he basically writes down and adds in exactly what he wants from you. The middle unit is boring as hell but the other 2 were great! Really likes us RC students too.", 
            "Fascinating class if you're interested in other cultures and movies. I hadn't taken a film class before this but his lectures that analyzed nearly every scene of every movie were a great introduction to the nature of the subject without being too fine-grained. He picked great movies as well. Take this if you're looking for a great RE elective.", 
            "It's definitely his way or the highway with this class. He is amiable generally, but there is only one way to interpret things, otherwise you're off the mark. The three long film analysis essays were tedious (as were their mandatory rewrites), and they are the only thing that determine your grade except for class attendance.", 
            "He is a nice guy who tries to help but is very opinionated and does not accept other viewpoints.", 
            "Be prepared for a lot of info packed into one lecture. Take advantage of office hours, he schedules lots and they're very helpful! I thought this class was interesting and easy to get an A in. Sounds like this class is quite GSI dependent, though\u2014the one I had was nit-picky, but thankfully Eagle graded most of my papers.", 
            "Try to avoid this class. My GSI was probably a very frustrated person who graded everything in the most subjective way possible. Both of them pick on the smallest things when they grade. Once I went to office hours and the professor wrote down the way the structure for the paper should look, and after doing exactly so the GSI told that was wrong", 
            "Very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. If you go to office hours be prepared for a short lecture. The course pack is helpful but not necessary. Don't need to be a SAC major to do well. Would recommend any class with him.", 
            "Unless you study films, stay away... very difficult. Herb is a very friendly guy and very knowledgeable about his class, but disagrees with almost everything his students say. He's great in office hours, but loves to talk and you can't get a word in. Some movies were good, some sucked. If you take this, I definitely recommend pass/fail!", 
            "If you write exactly what Herb says he wants you to write (for the essays), you will probably be fine. I try to bring my own interpretations of the films/readings to my papers, and I have gotten C+ both times so far because he just disagrees with me. Herb does not seem to be open-minded. This class is screwing my GPA so far, so beware.", 
            "Great professor. Extremely knowledgeable guy, has an amazing memory for small details of films. Can drone a bit in person, but he has a good sense of humor and his lectures are fascinating. Go to his office hours! Very helpful there for both papers and just talking about the films (most of which are quite interesting).", 
            "Very good professor, really analyzes all of the films well. It is key to take good notes in class-bring a computer and write down the pertinent things that he says, it makes the papers pretty easy to write. This class is much harder if you don't take notes. Overall, I enjoyed the class."

            "Prof Countryman is a really passionate person, but his lectures tended to be kind of dry. Criteria for group projects was not clearly laid out and lead to a lot of confusion. The section quizzes are the hardest part (very specific). I pretty much skipped all of the readings and just watched the documentaries. Final was pretty easy.", 
            "Prof Countryman rally knows his stuff and doesn't just define the Civil Rights Movement as starting in the 1960s. The readings and movies are interesting, but the movies/documentaries are definitely the most important homework. There's a group project based around civil rights which is frustrating, but Countryman is helpful with it.", 
            "Professor Countryman is a cool dude who's very passionate about his subject. However, his lecture slides are not very helpful. I also found his lectures extremely hard to listen to (he says \"um\" a LOT). There's a LOT of reading, but I didn't read a single thing until I needed to reference some for the final essays and still managed to get a B+.", 
            "Prof. Countryman is a very passionate but his lectures are long and a little dull. He was great but the GSI was not and her grading was all over the place. Even if you read everything, you will still get bad grades on the reading quizzes.", 
            "Professor Countryman is genuniely a nice person. Yet, his lectures are not organized and VERY DULL. Supposedly an easy class but the GSI (only one for entire class) is a tough grader - extremely picky! She seems like she doesn't want to give As to anyone (more towards A-s and B+s)", 
            "He was really disorganized throughout the semester, and the lectures are boring. It is an easy class, but very boring, and you only need to do the readings for section quizzes.", 
            "Professor Countryman isn't a mean or hard but his psi is. he also makes lectures super boring and says um every other word, I would not recommend this class.", 
            "Professor Countryman is an excellent educator and researcher. I took this class almost 2 years ago and I am thankful that he was my first professor at the university. As a transfer student I felt overwhelmed at first, but Prof. Countryman helped me get through the course and my other classes. He's a great mentor and friend. Take his classes.", 
            "good class, good prof.", 
            "Professor Countryman's lectures are long and he's not a great speaker, which doesn't help. It is worth it though, because the material is so interesting and really hits home. A lot of the readings are eye opening and worth reading.", 
            "Countryman is a very boring lecturer and I did not learn much from his class. There was no clear order to his lectures or thoughts.", 
            "The course is extremely interesting and you walk away with a great grasp on the politics and culture of the 1960s. Lectures are long and boring; sometimes the point of a subject is unclear. There's a lot of reading which isn't exactly necessary, but you should do some of them because they'll come back to haunt you on the final.", 
            "Professor Countryman loves to start a discussion and listen to the students take over. He will listen to all opinions, and although his is very nice, if your opinion is not rooted in the material, he will call you out. This is not a class that you can attend but not read, or read and not attend. You have to read, attend and participate for an A.", 
            "Mr. Countryman was a solid lecturer and a very knowledgeable professor for AMCULTAMHIST 374. The class is geared toward the raceethnicity requirement, so be prepared to spend half the semester on the Civil Rights Movement. Overall, good class, interesting material, and fair ability to succeed.", 
            "Everyone on here talking about his stammer sounds like a complete f'ing tool. Like he intentionally goes up there to make it hard for you to understand. Get a life!", 
            "Seriously one of the best professors I've had. He knows the material so well, is such a smart guy, and encourages great discussion throughout the class. His passion for the information discussed really shows every class, which makes the class really interested. Yeah, there's a lot of reading, but it's fascinating and very enjoyable.", 
            "Tons of reading for a lower level history course. Very interesting professor though and gives study guides for exams, and also very willing to help on papers if you meet with him in office hours. Second class with him- nice professor, very understanding. He's not an easy grader, but he's not super hard either.", 
            "Professor Countryman was a great professor. His lectures were a bit difficult to follow due to his stutter, but honestly, until someone pointed out his stutter to me mid-semester, it didn't bother me at all. There is a TON of reading assigned but it is pointless. The paper was the toughest part, and the exams were not that bad.", 
            "I enjoyed this class. The reading is not necessary to do at all and there is a lot of it so don't bother. If you do the study guides and understand the terms you should do fine on exams. The research paper was the hardest part of this class. It was interesting.", 
            "Dr.Countryman definitely cared about students on a personal level, and his lectures were very well structured and extremely interesting. His biggest strength is drawing off of a breadth of outside sources to supplement lecture materials. I highly recommend going to his office hours - as he is very willing to help. He's a pretty cool guy."

Even though PSYCH 230 is the toughest of the 200 level psych classes, Dr. Berridge's exams were very fair and his lectures were quite clear. He always put aside time in class so that students had the chance to ask questions. Make sure to take biopsychology with him!", 
            "Take this class with Berridge!!! Really knowledgeable in all lecture material, a true expert in his field. Exams could be a bit tricky because he'd slide in a couple questions that were covered specifically in lectures (so you kind of have to be there/paying attention), but otherwise they were a piece of cake. Discussion was pretty easy as well", 
            "If you have to take Psych 230 at UM, you need to take it with Berridge. Not only is he extremely qualified when it comes to class material, but he keeps the course material interesting throughout the entire semester. You'll need to study outside of class in order to do well, but no need to read the textbook to do well on exams.", 
            "Great professor! You need to put some work into studying for exams but every lecture is blue reviewed. Haven't opened the textbook once and I don't think it has made a difference in my grade at all. Definitely some interesting material in this class. Discussion points are easy and the group project is not too bad either.", 
            "Take this prof! easily one of the best professors I've had at Michigan thus far. He is widely respected in his field, and it shows during his lectures. This guy knows his stuff. Along with being easily overqualified to teach a 200 level course, he makes lecture fun and engaging, and is excellent at answering questions and explaining things well.", 
            "Dr. Berridge is absolutely hilarious, but he makes his exams beyond difficult. Unnecessarily so. His lectures are usually pretty interesting but studying for the exam is serious. This is not a blow-off \"oh it's just psych\" class, it's pretty difficult and very nit picky. Luckily Dr. Berridge makes lecture fun, so at least it's not boring.", 
            "Berridge is a fantastic lecturer (certainly the best Biopsych professor), he makes a complicated topic very easy to understand. He knows his stuff really well and is famous and respected in his field. Just attend lecture or watch all the blue reviews and you'll do fine.", 
            "I thought the topics he talked about were interested. A lot of memorization and being able to nail the exams. Typical psych class. Great professor though, very passionate and established in the field.", 
            "One of the best teachers I have had at U of M. He is hilarious and makes the material interesting.", 
            "Not a bad professor. Sometimes he was interesting but he was always prepared and was always very helpful. Everything is blue-reviewed, but you should still keep up with class. Memorizing the slides and what he says is the best way to pass his exams. Textbook isn't necessary. Discussion is easy points. Easy A if you're good with memorization.", 
            "Dr. Berridge clearly knew the material very well, but sometimes it wasn't very clearly explained. He recorded all the lectures. He made the lecture fly by; he's such an engaging speaker.", 
            "He's an amazing lecturer and person and I loved coming to class for him. While I do think he knows what he's talking about and did a good job presenting it, his exams were a little bit tough. Definitely be prepared to study hard for them and it shouldn't be too bad.", 
            "Professor Berridge is my favorite professor I've had here at Michigan. He finds the way to make an hour and a half lecture fun. His examples make concepts easy to understand and is very knowledgeable on the topics at hand.", 
            "Best professor I've had yet, by far. He actually comes to class ready to teach, and prepared. He is so wonderful, I'd love to take more classes with him.", 
            "Berridge is a funny guy and his lectures are pretty interesting. Doesn't hurt that all the stuff is review for science kids. Definitely recommend this classprofessor for pre-med students.", 
            "Wonderful professor and class. Even though slides may seem as if they're all over the place, it is easy to sort them out by category. Explained concepts thoroughly and always answered questions in class. If you study the slides very well, you will do great on exams. Discussion is easy points so don't blow those assignments off.", 
            "Very bio heavy class, making it more difficult than expected. It's obvious that Berridge is a smart guy, but I found it very hard to pay attention in class. Everything is blue reviewed though, so you can watch it later.", 
            "Overall one of my favorite professors. He is definitely an expert in this field and makes sure everyone is on board before moving on. The exams are very fair and he does his best to not let the lectures get boring. The class is somewhat bio heavy but its one of the better classes I've taken", 
            "Don't take this class if you're looking for an easy A. I thought it would be relatively easy, but this class is entirely bio based and i found it really difficult.he's an awful professor though and you don't need to read the textbook."

            "Good class, pretty easy, only requires you read the book/write down all the eqns on the way through for your notecard to get an A. Exams are basically identify which eqn to use on notecard, solve for a missing variable of eqn with given info, solve the overall eqn to get the correct answer. Lecture is VERY pointless as you learn NOTHING..literally", 
            "I got an A in Amidei's class. Physics is NOT easy at UofM, but I would recommend taking 126 with him. Judging from word of mouth & exams from other terms, his section seems to be a tad easier, comparatively. Good professor, I thought, & cares a lot about his students. He even felt BAD about our 15/20 exam average for the 2nd exam! TWO THUMBS UP.", 
            "Good prof. The quizdoms were easy and he often would basically give us the answer. I found the way he lectures okay, usually just wrote down the formulas and was fine for the online hw. Exams were doable with A-/B+ averages. Really helpful and a goofy guy. Always wears the same black pants!",

            "Dante is the man! If you had trouble with 125 you will be pleased with 126, MUCH easier, especially with Dante. He is very helpful and exams are pretty easy (averages were 17 or 18 out of 20). As long as you do the hw, make a note card, and do the practice exam, you'll be fine!", 
            "He is extremely enthusiastic, but lecture is pointless. He tries and cares but the lecture material does not cover all the material that is needed for exams. Exams were fairly easy though.", 
            "Good professor, very entertaining and easy to understand. His exams were pretty easy and in lecture he will basically give you the answers to quizdom questions.",

            "Great guy, interesting lecture. A gem among physics professors because he makes demos fun and also likes to help students. Lectures are clear and exams are reasonable.", 
            "Amidei is hilarious and entertaining. He also tried to gear this class to those who will be taking physics for practical rather than theoretical purposes, which I really appreciated. Honestly, it seems like he's the best option for a subject that can otherwise drive even the best student insane.", 
            "this class sucked... amidei is a good guy, but the concepts that were tested were !@#$%. It's good that he understands that people only take this class to further the requirements for their future careers and that no one really cares about the class... overall, good professor, bad experience.",

Cares about her students so much, and offers a lot of extra credit. 3 short papers and 3 tests where she explain throughly how to complete them successfully. Really interesting lectures and you don't have to read the textbook. Pay attention to lectures and you will do great!", 
            "Extremely funny, kind, and understanding. The two hour lecture flies by. It's nice that there's no separate discussion section. Everyone at U of M should take a class with her while they're here. She's extremely knowledgeable about psychology- she has her own private practice and a clear passion for the subject. One of the best professors I've had!",

            "She thinks she's really funny, but she's actually not. Which turns out to be funny. The only thing that gets people to lecture is filling in the blanks in the lecture outlines. Lots of memorization and no conceptual learning so it was boring to me. Not very on top of posting practice exams and other stuff ahead of time.",

There's a good amount of memorization; each class presents a lot of info. It's inherent in the goal of the class (to build a foundation). Schreier makes you want to do it. It was the perfect way to start Psych at UM.",

This class is only an easy A if you actually study and do the extra credit assignments (unless you're like a prodigy at memorization). The exams test on minute details of slides, so don't treat them like they're nothing.",

So easy to talk to and her explanations are really clear. This is a hard class, but if you put in the time to learn the material it will actually pay off.", 
            "Bio 172 is so hard and very tricky. Go to as many office hours as you can and Laury will make sure that you get out of there with the best information and knowledge of what to expect. I'm not good at Biology and loved how helpful she was. Bio 172 is very tough so make sure you get her and go to office hours!", 
            "Professor Wood's class, which I took during this past summer term, was probably the best biology class I have ever had, and compared to Bio 171 and those professors, she was way better than any of them. She was clear and explicit in what the tests would be from, she explained everything to such great detail in lectures, and had great office hours.", 
            "Took her for 172 in the summer. She explains concepts well. Clearly wants her students to succeed, and patiently explains concepts till students get them. Tests are difficult and they require an eye for detail, but are still fair. Some of the slides honestly weren't very good, but she explained things well anyway. Very nice too.", 
            "Avoid taking Dr. Wood as your lecturer and exam maker like the plague! Her exams are much harder than other professors who teach the course. If you choose to take the class, memorize her Bluereview and take it as your only class. You also should read before going to lecture if you have time. Get as many practice exams created by her as possible.", 
            "She is, without a doubt, one of the nicest and best professors that I have ever encountered at this university. I highly recommend taking her section, especially if you are a CSP student. Coming out of this class I have not only learned a lot about Biology, but I also have found a good friend in Professor Wood.", 
            "I really liked Laury Wood as a professor but she is very knowledgeable of the subject so sometimes you have to ask her to slow down to better explain what she's teaching. If you do ask her for help, she is very helpful & will explain it in a way that makes sense."

            "GREAT CLASS! learned a lot! his style of teaching is among the best if not the best. that was the first class and probably only class that i looked forward to going to , i literally wanted to go everyday! he knew how to keep the class interested! very entertaining!", 
            "If you were looking for an easy Umich polisci class, you found it. We just showed up every day, maybe went through 8-10 slides (which he gave us before each exam), and he literally did the review sheet for us. Take the class if you want to be entertained on a bi-weekly basis and get an easy A", 
            "The class was very easy and it's because of his laid back manner and slow paced class style. We had one paper all semester and a midterm and a final. Super easy, and a very unique guy, a bit maniacal. He ges sidetracked and distracted very easily. I didn't learn very much, but I got an A, so overall it was a decent experience.", 
            "Take any class with him. One of the coolest professors you'll have, and not difficult if you apply minimal effort.", 
            "He is a really cool guy, with a crazy laugh. Very easy class.", 
            "If you value your time, don't waste it on him. Attendance is 25% of your grade, but other than the points, its a waste of time to go to class. He talked more about himself and personal stories than about the actual topic. By the end of the quarter we were so far behind we were basically forced to teach ourselves. Its not hard, just pointless.", 
            "He is absolutely terrible. I hated every minute of class. I would advise you to NEVER EVER take anything he teaches. I wouldn't even consider him a teacher. He's awful. I hated him and the class.", 
            "Very cool dude...Has fun teaching and is very down to earth smart! Take his Class!", 
            "Professor McClerking is amazing. He is the most laid-back professor in the entire world (he wears a T-shirt and a baseball cap every day and does not hesitate to use profanity), and his laugh is infectious. His class is incredibly fun; it consists mostly of talking about race. Attendance is 25% of the grade.", 
            "This guy is hilarious. You learn more about Blade Runner and Depeche Mode probably more than you learn about the subject matter. Still, the guy is really cool and has a lot of great stories. Attendance is 25% of the grade. McClerking rules.", 
            "He was a great prof! Had him last quarter and got an a. taking another course with him again. you learn a lot and can have great discussion!!!", 
            "One of the best Political Science Classes at OSU. Exams consist of multiple choice questions and short-essay questions. And one research paper to be written. There are tons of fun and full of active discussions. Don't miss the chance to take his class.", 
            "He's a good professor. You MUST go to class to pass though. Exams were easy as long as you studied.", 
            "His laugh is RIDICULOUS but everyone gets used to its wispy banter. He talks a lot about Michigan where he got his phD and Mississippi (of course, where he grew up). Honestly though, you do not learn very much, he is at times unprofessional (dress, otherwise), and everyone just seems to do the minimal to get the A. Good class discussions, though.", 
            "McClerking is a pretty cool teacher. The midterm and final are easy to study for. But I feel like I got cheated on my essay. He asks for so many specifics on the rubric but doesn't weigh how much each part is worth. I did alot of research and followed every instruction but got an 80 with no real reason at all. He is also late when returning papers!", 
            "If you show up to class and study at all you will get an A in this class. Professor McClerking has a crazy laugh, and talks about Mississippi A LOT, but its a nice break from the normally boring class.", 
            "He's not bad for an A/A- in a usually difficult Poly Sci department. Rambles on a lot and has the most ridiculous laugh you'll ever hear which makes it unique. Tests are 23 multiple choice with 2 \"fill in the blank\" -- if you study, they're really easy. Attendance is mandatory and is 25% of grade. Not bad at all for a GEC or for POLIT SC majors.", 
            "LOVED this class! I recommend anyone to take any class he teaches. He makes the material interesting and challenges your thoughts into a new perspective. His laugh will make YOU laugh!", 
            "Class was a cake walk. Coming to 504 is 25% of your grade so you pretty much have to come. Very biased in his opinion and can really beat-around the bush. Moderately boring but he has ways to spark attention, mostly by his ridiculous laugh. I suggest taking this class due to its supreme ease.", 
            "awesome professor. The class is interesting and he allows a forum for discussion. His laugh is very distinctive.. and he says \"Mississippi\" A LOT."

            "Dr. Duan teaches the 1st and 4th sections of this course. He was slightly better and more engaging than Dr. Xu. This class is graded on 4 exams only, but they arent cumulative and there are up to 8 extra credit points available per tests. No curve. I honestly found the textbook to be more useful than going to lecture. Exams are straightforward.", 
            "Dr. Duan is fantastic. His expectations are clear and he is very willing to help if you are struggling. He spends a lot of time going over topics that are difficult and he essentially tells you what is going to be on the exams. This class has a lot of memorization but it is all manageable. He also offers a lot of extra credit on exams.", 
            "I took this class after Bio 225 and Professor Duan is definitely one of my favorite teachers at UM! The material was really interesting and we learned a lot of pathways in depth, but also in the scope of real research currently going on. Professor Duan was always available to answer questions and really looks to make you fully grasp the concept.", 
            "I had Dr. D for both Bio 225 and MCDB 426 and greatly enjoyed taking both classes. He always make sure to cover the complicated topics slowly, and also spends part of each lecture reviewing the previous day's material. Exams are fair and clear- good guy!", 
            "Dr. Duan was a great lecturer! Although his accent sometimes interfered with my comprehension of the lecture material, you can still get by in understanding what he is saying. Be prepared to study ALL the course material mentioned in lecture outside of class. This will comprise the entirety of his two exams.", 
            "Professor Duan is great. He cares about his students and is always willing to help. He has many office hours that are very helpful. Be sure to study. This content is not particularly challenging, however, there is a lot of material. Lectures are not recorded. Attend lecture. You will learn a lot from this interesting course.", 
            "I would recommend any class with Cunming. His cheerful personality and clear way of lecturing made animal physiology great, though the subject material is already interesting. He is also more than willing to get to know his students. Attend every lecture and ask questions in office hours, and you will not find it difficult to get an A.", 
            "I took both Endocrinology and Animal Physiology with Dr. Duan. Classes were not easy. However, Prof. Duan was always very clear on what he was going to test us on and was always available to help in office hours and before/after class. Additionally, exams were fair, enabling a very positive experience in both these classes. Highly recommend.", 
            "I took Endocrinology in Summer 2015, and it way my best experience in a science course at UM. The class was small and Prof. Duan was very willing to answer individual questions. He reviewed material he noticed students were struggling with and was consistently available in office hours. Exams were fair. He made endocrinology very interesting.", 
            "Duan is an endocrinologist so he definitely knows what he's talking about in his class. It's very informative and he'll go over things with you if you don't understand it. Definitely a class I'd recommend taking with him.", 
            "You definitely need to spend time going over the slides but he makes everything very clear. Awesome class", 
            "Tests are fair. But lot of material.", 
            "Duan is an extremely helpful professor, and I think that he really does his best to help students by being available via office hours. He is extremely passionate, and he truly does give a clear outline of what you need to know to do well. The readings are most definitely required.", 
            "225 requires a lot of specific memorization. Study all the pictures and diagrams that Duan presents. There is blue review but if youre struggling, go to lecture and his office hours so he gets a chance to know you. He is very passionate about his research & class and really wants his students to succeed. Also, i found the textbook very helpful", 
            "He usually teaches half of this course but his exams are much harder. He tests from the book even if he says he doesn't. You have to study everything in the lecture and book and it still might be hard.", 
            "Professor Duan was an awesome teacher. You can tell he is passionate about the material and wants his students to succeed.", 
            "Bio 225 is a course that relies on lots of memorization. That being said, Duan's lectures are very clear and the exams are fairly written. Each exam has a few bonus questions, too. If you study quite a bit before the exams and stay caught-up on lecture material, this course isn't bad. Duan does a great job teaching this course.", 
            "He was confusing at times, and sometimes he said the wrong thing, but overall he was a really nice person and the way he talked made lecture much less boring than it could have been. Really tries to help the students, and tries to make the info as clear as possible, even though sometimes his accent can get in the way.", 
            "Cunming is a really good guy and professor. It may take a little bit to get used to his accent but he really wants everyone to do well. He takes the time to answer questions and is willing to help however he can. Highly recommend him", 
            "Duan teaches the second half of this course, and I like him better than the first professor. His exams are slightly harder, but he's easier to understand. He's very willing to help students and is generally a nice guy. Lectures are blue reviewed and the class is pretty much just straight memorization from lectures. Never opened the book."

            "San obviously knows what he's talking about, but his lectures can be pretty dry, especially in the morning. I really like the subject material, but if you don't you'll probably zone out. He's very sweet and willing to help. The class is very easy aside from a term project which is a bit of a pain.",

He makes jokes sometimes and it's so cute because you can tell that he thinks he's hilarious, but I think everyone is a little too sleepy to catch on. The course material was very interesting and San wants his students to do well.", 
            "I did have a very high interest in Linguistics, however, I found his lectures very boring. Make sure you go to discussion though, you go over problem sets and really learn the material there. I rarely went to lecture, missed a few discussions and still managed to get a B, kind of a fool proof class.",

Professor Duanmu talks sort of slow, and I can see how it would be easy to lose focus if you weren't interested in the class. But it's obvious that he really loves phonetics, which made the class enjoyable. The class was an easy seminar, but fun if you're", 
            "Super easy class. Incredibly boring. Open-book, open-note \"exams\" twice throughout the semester in class. Main project was a poster that took maybe 10 minutes and the lowest grade you could get was an A-... Would recommend if you're looking for an easy A, but not if you're actually interested in linguistics.",

            "You can see that Duanmu tried really hard during his lecture. Although he did read word for word, it allowed the material to sink in. I reread the slides before the exam and could actually recall what he said during lecture. I am still interested in linguistics, but I probably won't take a class from him again.", 
            "The material was very interesting at times but the professor made me hate linguistics and the class. The professor is extremely boring, reads of the slide word for word and talks very very slowly. The GSI's seemed confused and didn't how to answer questions and don't help. Can skip lecture and memorize word for word for exams", 
            "Very boring, reads straight from the slides. GSIs are not very helpful and mine couldn't even speak English that well. Not that hard since most answers can be found in the textbook (which you don't really need to read) but some things require you to understand and apply the concepts. Overall, not that hard but so boring.", 
            "He's a really nice guy, but his lectures were boring and not very helpful. If you go to him for help, he's pretty nice but his GSIs, or at least the one I had, was terrible at explaining things. In fact, she even refused to answer questions sometimes. This class would've been interesting if the material was explained better.",

            "Cannot express it enough how great of a professor this guy is. This is the only class where I actually wanted to show up. You should have an open mind when hearing him talk because he is really intelligent and provides many good points about current events. Do the papers, respect the fact that its still a college course. Randy is the absolute best.", 
            "Randy is the professor who made me WANT to attend a lecture. He always has the most amazing topics picked out to discuss in class, and he is hilarious. He gives amazing feedback on the rough draft of your paper, but you don't talk much about it in class (not that that's a bad thing). It's an awesome class filled with useful information and laughs.", 
            "Randy is an excellent instructor and person. There is never a boring lecture with him and he provides you with clear, genuinely helpful feedback on your writing. He's a very lenient grader; show effort and a willingness to participate and you should do well in his class. I'd recommend him to anyone taking a writing course here!", 
            "Gives amazing feedback on your papers. Never talk about writing in the class itself - rather we discuss current events and controversial issues that can be implemented into your paper. Not a hard grader - put in the effort and show genuine interest and you'll be fine. Love him as a person and professor.", 
            "I adored Randy he's one of the best lecturers at Michigan. His class is unconventional and fun and would love to take another class with him. Don't take this class if you're too conservative and aren't open minded.", 
            "You should get some type of A in the course if you attend class and participate. You should also do all the work like I did. I highly recommend taking English 225 or any English class with Randall Tessier since he is the fairest (most lenient) professor teaching the course. However, he needs to cover essential writing topics more than he does now.", 
            "Randy is by far the greatest teacher I have ever had at UofM. You just show up to class and you talk about current events or sports or anything he feels like talking about that day. He is very caring about his students and gives great feedback on papers. I would highly recommend him.", 
            "Randy's class is always very fun. His lectures are crazy and entertaining. If you do all your work, you'll most likely get an A.", 
            "Randy is a good teacher if you're looking for an easy class. His lectures are entertaining, and he is always open to hearing your opinion. As far as actual assignments go, he never really gives a rubric for his essays (which is frustrating to say the least) but you get to revise every major essay so it's not that big of a deal.", 
            "My favorite teacher. Great all around.", 
            "Randy is one of the best professors at umich. I took 125 and 225 with him and would do it all over again if I could. He is very approachable and helps you so much with your papers. Also, the discussions in class are always hilarious. I always looked forward to his class.", 
            "Very easy A and lax class. Gives a paper very 2 weeks, checks it, gives it back with feedback and then you turn it back in revised for your final-grade. Very understanding and also has a great, crude, sense of humor.", 
            "Randy was a great teacher. Really helpful and doesnt ask for too much work. He will definitely improve your writing skills! 100% recommend him!!", 
            "Such a good professor. Take him for any English class. Very personable and approachable and just a great professor overall.", 
            "Had Randy for ENG 125 and 225, he is amazing and helps a ton with your writing. Great guy to get along with. By far the best professor I have had here. I encourage students to take this class :)", 
            "If you ever want to take English 125, 225, or 325, take it with this man! You will not regret it. Trust everyone's word on this. He is the most down to earth professor I have met at the university. He helps you a lot with your papers and the class discussions are 100% fun and 90% fun learning.He's hilarious too.If you want a great time:RandyTessier",

This was my favorite class at Michigan thus far, and will be taking more of his classes in the future. If you openly seek out office hours and pay attention in lecture (show up) it is SO rewarding and interesting.", 
            "Bless his heart. Clearly a knowledgeable and personable professor, with a huge amount of passion for his subject, but the lectures were awful to listen to and attendance was not mandatory.", 
            "Was very excited for this class but ended up being my least favorite of the semester. Interesting material, but lectures were a waste of my time and only doing the readings will get you an A. He has a lot of pet peeves of mine as a lecturer, like saying \"um\" a lot and not making it relevant to graded material. Nice guy, but don't care for.", 
            "Kevin is an amazing professor and super funny. I had almost no interest in the class before I took it but he really made the topic interesting and answered any questions I had. Aside from that, Kevin really tries to make everyone feel comfortable. I would recommend him to everyone!", 
            "I had absolutely no interest in Japanese Art. Dr. Carr made this my favorite class at umich. Extremely helpful, clear, and downright hilarious. The perfect professor you get in college once or twice. Truly a joy to have taken this class.", 
            "Material is pretty interesting, and you honestly don't need to do much. I have never taken an Art History class before and I got an A. Professor Carr is super nice, but his lectures aren't really worth going to in my opinion. You are never tested on lecture material and he doesn't check attendance. Do the readings and you'll be more than fine.", 
            "Class was easy, but very bad. For anyone with a Japanese studies background, his lectures are not cohesive or valuable. Very bland and cursory analyses without making any REAL arguments. He is likable but nothing he says is challenging or thought-provoking. He would make outrageous staements like AIDs not being a threat anymore. Easy. Not valuable.", 
            "The best professor I've ever had -- passionate, knowledgeable, goes out of his way to bring students up to level. If you have even a shred of interest in Japan or art history, I could not recommend his classes more. To the person who said they were \"easy\" and that you can write the papers the night before: maybe, but you're just cheating yourself.", 
            "Professor Carr is THE MAN. I had absolutely no interest in Asian Art, took the class only to fulfill the distribution requirement, but had a wonderful time anyway! What a smart guy! totally passionate about Japanese art AND about teaching. cute, funny.. you will fall in love.", 
            "He doesn't actually do any of the grading, he has a grader, but his scale is really easy, a 67% is a C+. Stutters a ton, it can get kind of annoying. If you aren't interested in the subject area I don't recommend taking one of his classes.", 
            "This was my favorite class!!! If Professor Carr teaches another 1st seminar I would totally recommend it!! I plan on taking another class this semester with him because I loved this class so much!", 
            "Prof. Kevin Carr is an incredibly busy guy with tons on his plate, yet he always makes time for students. His classes, whether you have prior interest or not, will reel you in and keep you wanting to take more! His passion for the material and sense of humor, as well as openness to student suggestions, make him one of the BEST profs U of M has.", 
            "Took this class on a fluke to get the humanity credits. Class grade is 25% participation in section and the rest is based on three papers. Wrote all of the papers the night before they were due, got almost 100% on each one. Highly recommend this class!",

I had him 6 hrs a week for two classes & I had the best semester. Talks a bit fast but once u get used to his style he is very clear overall. Creative and essentric, NEVER boring. If u put effort in, guarenteed good marks.",

            "A very difficult task, his lectures are a bit lacking. Very dry, and his lecture slides are too full to fully understand what's going on while trying to take notes. He really likes what he does though, and he is always willing to help. If you can make office hours, do it. He's very approachable.", 
            "This (despite my best efforts) was the second time I had Barry (I had him for Chem 130 also). Barry is a really nice guy, but he cannot think on the level of an undergrad, as things that seem fundamental to him often have the class confused. Barry team taught chem 260 with Kevin Kubarych, and I thought Kubarych helped cover Barry's deficiencies.",

Chem 130 is fairly easy as long as you read the book and do your OWLS and if you must have the lecture attend a different profs.",

            "Great in office hours. GO TO OFFICE HOURS IF U WANNA DO GOOD! I made the mistake of not going until the second exam", 
            "He contradicts himself alot, but tries to make you think he was right all along. Definitely one of the most difficult professors to understand, not only with language barrier, but even he sentences and concepts are just plain confusing. For your sake try to do what you can to avoid his lectures. If you're in them, go to another lecturer's", 
            "Very difficult to comprehend, and contradicts himself a lot!",

I only had one year of chemistry in high school , and with Chem 130 being an intro to chemistry it should have not been as intense as it was. I barely learned anything in this class and now I have to take it again. Hope you're proud Professor!",

The only reason I did ok on my exams was because I studied the textbook and what I remembered from my 2 years of chemistry from high school Only go to class to answer the Quizdoms (which he repeats every class anyways). Lastly, he tends not to not answer q's well",

You could get a better grade by doing the problems (and book problems) repeatedly.",

It made me a far more critical thinker while also rendering me more open-minded.",

The lectures were a little long and got a little rough because it is just him lecturing, but he gives you a 10 min break. Lets you write your papers about whatever interests u",

I'd recommend this class to anyone who wants a different class than usual.",

He's very relaxed; as someone mentioned he says that attendance is optional (but there are rewards for going!). The papers are very manageable albeit long.",

            "Dr. J is a very encouraging and humorous Professor. I dont think the exams covered thoroughly what I studied and what was taught in the course enough. It's almost you walk out of the examination room wishing you had been asked more questions, because there are many fun terms and models to learn in macroeconomics. A caring Professor. Get to know him", 
            "Worst Professor I have ever had at Umich. Ridiculously confusing, luckily GSI was decent. Took in summer, avoid taking with johnson (he only teaches in summer) if possible. coursepack makes no sense, made understanding the material even more difficult. He isn't too hard of a grader, you basically do well or poorly on his exams, not much inbetween.", 
            "Best professor I ever had. I took his class in 1980 and still remember most of my Macroeconomic theory taught. I took the class after work from 11:30 to 7:30 overnight and went to his 8:00 class. Professor Johnson was very funny and entertaining. His exam review was highlighted by passing out small humorous prizes for offering correct answers.", 
            "those who have the new 102 teacher; consider yourselves lucky. this guy was absolutely horrible.", 
            "I liked Dr J. he tries to make his lectures funny, and he does seem to know what he is talking about.", 
            "his class was difficult but he knew what he was doing... i think he would be better off teaching a higher level class because he doesnt always realize his students are completely lost.. i failed the first 2 exams but ended up with a B+ because it took me that long to figure out the material...", 
            "This guy was a joke. He knew nothing about what he was teaching. The courseback was rediculously hard to understand. Basically we all had to teach ourselves to understand his madness.", 
            "He is by FAR the WORST professor at the University. He makes awful jokes, and honestly, I am not convinced that he actually knows the material. He constantly contradicts himself (in lectures and in the coursepack). The coursepack has horrible grammar (preschool level) which confuses the crap out of everyone. If he is retiring, he did you a favor.", 
            "Wow. I can't say enough bad things about Johnson. There's only a coursepack and it has a typo every three words. I've learned more about Lloyd Carr than about macroeconomics. Why couldn't he have retired a semester earlier?", 
            "bad teacher, letures are confusing so noone goes, coursepack is even worse. the grading scale is relitivly fair, so 75 is a B- but exams are very hard and only 18 questions so if you mess up your screwed. no chance of getting an A and you find yourself studying nonstop to keep up", 
            "Very funny guy. His jokes makes a dry subject matter very interesting. The tests are not too difficult.", 
            "This is a horrible class. Professor Johnson has created his own version of macroeconomics that is taught from a horrible course pack that he wrote and is virtually impossible to follow. Half of the material he covers in the CP and lectures is not relevant to anything we should be learning in Econ 102. It's unnecessarily complicated. Avoid.", 
            "Professor J is great! Material a little difficult but his tests are not hard. Also he is very funny! Take Econ 102 with him for sure.", 
            "Ok, Johnson is an awful professor. His leacture are only good because every now and then he will put something on the exam from what he said in lecture. He makes a lot of jokes, which is the only thing that makes the class interesting. His grading is sooooo liberal!", 
            "Aweful...avoid at all costs. He makes horrible jokes, and does not teach the material, not entertaining. Very boring. His coursepack has a ton of errors in it, and he contradicts himself all the time, and never corrects it. The coursepack itself has horrible grammar, making it very hard to read and/or understand.", 
            "Makes more jokes about nose candy aka cocaine and how spoiled the students are since a good amount are from long island NY then clear points about the subject. Horrible teacher.", 
            "His lectures are awfully boring. His jokes aren't that funny. The coursepack sucks and is confusing as hell, but the class is easy if you can tolerate being bored every damn lecture.", 
            "Do not take econ 102 with johnson, whatever it takes. His coursepack is the worst ever and is never corrected. Half the the time he makes mindless and stupid jokes and never really says what is important. If he tells you something is not going to be on the test,expect it on there twice. He never answers questions good and just goes off on rant.", 
            "This guy was hilarious but I hated the class. The coursepack is horrible with numerous errors that are never corrected semester after semester. His tests aren't the hardest though (midterms 18 ques mul choice and final 40 ques..i think...mul choice). Even if you do bad you do good...it's just annoying in the meantime."

            "Don't take this class. One of the hardest along with the Aerospace section. A lot more work required than the other Eng100s. She teaches you the basics in class, but the homework and exams are so much harder than you can ever expect. A lot of busy work with Team Logs, Peer Evals, Clinician Evals, etc. Interested in BME? Take ENG 100 Section 100", 
            "Her lectures weren't perfect but were decent and she responded well to questions in class and in office hours. I did not find lectures to be as confusing and homework to be as difficult as described by other reviewers. You will probably need to get help from both the professors and other students but the class is not bad at all.", 
            "I was initially excited to take my first biotechnology course. But Schmedlen thoroughly ruined biotechnology for me. Lectures are confusing and homework is difficult. The class wasn't terrible until the MRI lectures, students would purposely miss lecture so she wouldn't confuse them. Great lady, accessible for help outside of class. Terrible prof", 
            "She is very bad at explaining things. The lectures are confusing. Literally learned through Youtube. But some of the things we talked about can't be found anywhere... Homework overly hard compare to the lectures. Killed BME for me.", 
            "Incredibly challenging class. I would not recommend this if you didn't take AP Bio, no matter what your advisor says. Dr S's office hours are an immense help with homeworks, but lecture is confusing and vague. Luckily, she upload lecture slides and sample questions to CTools, so the resources are there.", 
            "I took ENGR100 with her and it was one of the biggest mistakes I made freshman year. The course description sounds interesting and I was actually really excited for the class. What they don't mention is the enormous course-load and all the material you need to learn IN ADDITION to creating a diagnostic test device.", 
            "Dr. S is a super friendly teacher who really means well. She holds office hours just for homework help that are very useful. Unfortunately, she can be extremely confusing when it comes to the more advanced topics we cover, and asks questions that are extremely vague. This is the hardest Engineering 100 section you can take because of that.", 
            "Not a very good lecturer. Very unclear in class. Tests are very difficult. Nice lady, but not a good professor. I was thinking of going biomedical, but this class turned me off to the idea. I don't recommend this class or her as a professor.", 
            "Does not explain or teach well.", 
            "I was interested in BME but this class is making me change my mind. The effort you have to put in this class is not worth the grade. (I spent more time here than in orgo and calc 2. As a result, I had a rough semester) This class was tough. All the reviews from the past are true, Rachael puts most people to sleep almost every class.", 
            "Dr. Schmedlen is not the most clear instructor. Her explanations are kind of confusing sometimes. But she is very helpful in terms of setting up meeting times with us. She works around our schedule and make sure you get what you come for.", 
            "While she does try to make her class accessible, her lectures fall short. I do not doubt that she is very intelligent, but her lectures are often vague and lack clarity. She does offer ample office hours but her answers rarely answer the original questions. Overall, she is a weak teacher for anyone without a very strong biotech background.", 
            "Dr. Schmedlen is a good instructor overall. Sometimes the way she explains things in lecture makes it hard to understand. Make sure you go to her office hours for homework. Her wording is pretty confusing sometimes and it's hard to figure out what she is asking for. Go through the homework with her so that you are answering the right thing", 
            "I was really surprised at these reviews. I thought Schmedlen was a great lecturer. She loves the material, and tries to get the class involved. She listens to student input and changed certain things she did to help the class out. The class itself is very difficult, but she works around your schedule to make sure you understand the material.", 
            "Dr. Schmedlen really knows what she is talking about. However, sometimes her language can be esoteric and that makes it hard to understand. She tries to have more office hours, but the course requires so much work, that you can't get everything out of office hours. The exams are extremely difficult.", 
            "Wow! I was cruising through all my professors that I hate relishing in their horrible reviews and this one I really don't get! Schmedlen is one of the only lecturers I like, She does fine at explaining the concepts if you're willing to listen. I can't imagine the people who wrote these bad reviews ended up majoring in BME. GOOD PROF.", 
            "Just to clarify...she's actually NOT a professor at all, just a lecturer. And an incompetent one at that. If you can, save yourself some frustration and avoid her as much as possible.", 
            "This class was really demanding (tough exams, lots of techcom papers and presentations), but don't let that deter you if you think BME is your thing. Rachael is better than she gets credit for on here and holds lots of office hours and review sessions (with pizza) before exams and is knowledgeable about the subject.", 
            "She's an awful teacher. Her voice is annoying, and I fell asleep every time I went to lecture. The only good thing about the class was working with my group. She had nothing to do with that. It was Mimi that arranged the groups. Rachael is awful! Don't take this class even if it's the last one left!", 
            "Not really a teacher. She is outwardly fairly nice, but cannot teach. She consistently puts about a third of her class to sleep with most of the rest screwing around on their laptops. She seems like a very smart professor, but she is unable to convey her own understanding to you. In addition, she is not helpful for the project, gives bad advice"

Willing to cancel meetings for extra office hours, INCREDIBLY PASSIONATE AND CARING, expanded on instead of teaching material in lecture but lecture was EPIC, VPYTHON IS SO MUCH WORK, but I learned a lot. GO TO OFFICE HOURS if he knows you try you're grade is better (80 to A-)",

A friendly reminder: although you can definitely learn a lot from physics 160, if you don't plan to major in physics, or your major/minor doesn't require physics, or you hate homework, think again before you take that course.",

I got a 50% on the final with 67% on the quizzes and still got a B, so you don't need to get good grades to end the class with a good grade. I highly suggest phys 160 over 140 especially with professor Orr",

            "Brad is a great guy and interesting lecturer. Although, in lecture, he teaches a lot more about the math behind the physics, and while it is interesting, you need to make sure know how to actually do the problems that will be on the quizzes. GO TO OFFICE HOURS. Office hours are what make him great. He will help with anything ans is just great.",

Professor Orr knows that he teaches a class that's very tough for first semester students, but he's always more than willing to help you every step of the way. While you aren't graded on attendance, you need to show up or you won't pass.",

The work can be tough, but Orr is more than willing to help you out and will more often than not extend deadlines if students request it. Very encouraging guy.", 
            "Orr is a great professor who challenges students. If you take 160 with him, it will be tough. You will get out of the class what you are willing to put in,and Brad will always be willing to help you and give you a break if you are trying your best. He says AP Physics is not necesary, if you are don't have it, prepare to be willing to work very hard", 
            "He's extremly passionate about his students learning . I spent hours every week in his office hours for help on the homework. His lecture style is like no other and it can be confussing depending on how you learn. This class requires a lot of work, prior physics knowledge and knowing coding is a plus. The quizzes are hard but there is a soild curve", 
            "He actually cares what the student learns. I was just glad that I took this class. He is very passionate; asks students if they are stressed, and the amount of assignments given depends on the students' response. Down side is that you have to have some elementary knowledge about physics, along with some math background. It is best taken with Calc 2",

I definitely recommend taking 160 with Brad (if you already took physics C in high school). The course is more interesting than 140 and the average is a B+A-. Don't buy the textbook.",

Do the readings, pay attention in lecture and you will do well.", 
            "You can tell that Janko loves his work and is a top contributor in his field. The coursework was heavy, but manageable. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Classics, but not to someone who just is looking to get the FYWR over with. The class was really interesting.", 
            "The midterm and final were difficult, but manageable. The lectures were interesting and you could tell that Janko loved his work and is a brilliant scholar. I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in Classics and anyone planning on majoring on Classics.", 
            "People have said that they didnt' like Janko... He is a wonderful guy, very personable and he DOES want you to do well. The exams are curved, but they are difficult. I personally loved the subject matter, so attending lecture was not a problem for me. My GSI for the class was great, so that definitely helped. Nonetheless, I ended up with a B.",

            "Professor Janko is a genuinely nice guy, however the exams are HARD and the grading on the essays are entirely up to the GSI's in the course. It was impossible to stay awake during lecture... this course is too much work for a first year writing requirement and I would NOT recommend taking this course unless you absolutely LOVE Greek culture."

            "Tests you a lot on pure memorization, which doesn't enhance learning or critical thinking skills, but basically reinforces whats wrong with the education system. Memorize this, regurgitate it on an exam, bye. Not a great Professor, but the material is moderately interesting, could be worse.", 
            "Great and interesting lecturer. Study questions mandatory to get that A. Unless you've dropped by in office hours and introduced yourself he really isn't accessible (doesn't give that welcoming vibe when walking by him) outside class.", 
            "Great lecturer in my opinion. Yes, there's a lot of work and reading, but if you really want a solid foundation in understanding international economics this is a solid course. Lectures super interesting. I'm taking this at the same time as ECON 102, and there's a lot of overlapping material which helps a lot. Yes, you need to read the textbook!!", 
            "Currently stuck with the outcome of this class, as I didn't heed the numerous warnings on here. Please for you own sanity, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS unless you are ready to spend a lot of hours memorizing stuff you may not ever see again. I definitely regret taking it. Even the GSIs says it is an unnecessarily hard class. STAY AWAY from this class!!!", 
            "Too much memorization for a 300 level economics course. The material is designed to be for non-economics majors, so there's a LOT of focus on readings. Most of the exams were just regurgitated material of what we did in class and a lot of little details that you might not think were important. Memorize everything, acronyms, statistics, names, etc.", 
            "Consistently scored above the class average and appreciate a challenging course when it is made up of genuinely difficult material. Do not appreciate a professor who intentionally makes his course more difficult than it needs to be, not through the content itself, but through the vexatious way he tests and grades students Lots of rote memorization", 
            "Easily one of the best Professors that I've taken at Michigan. This class will change the way you view the world and the world economy. It's by no means an easy A, but the material is very learnable if you work at it, and it's possible to ace the class even if you aren't an Econ major or have only taken 101/102.", 
            "Professor Deardorff is one of the best Professors I've had at Michigan. He is one of the best trade economists in the world, yet takes the time to plan amazing lectures and work with students until they understand the material. Tests aren't easy, but are based fairly on the lecture slides and study questions posted online.", 
            "Alan Deardorff is one of the best professor I've ever studied with, let alone his world-class reputation. He gave very clear explanations on the hard-to-digest topics. Though he is a tough grader, he is quite fair on the grading policy based on your quality of work and attempts.", 
            "International Trade Policy. Seems interesting right? WRONG. This is the worst class I've taken at U-M. Deardorff is self-centered and arrogant. He patronizes students who try to participate. The lectures are tedious and boring. I sat with my friend, surfing Facebook and texting trying to evade the prof's eyes to save myself from public humiliation.",

            "My favorite class last semester. The Professor was awesome, and he incorporated economic news into the class too. But be prepared to put in a lot of hard work for this class, which includes memorizing a LOT of factual information, definition and acronym. I would highly recommend this class for its broad perspective", 
            "Although Prof. Deardorff makes the class interesting, the class is just poorly structured. The exams rely too heavily upon factual information and they test on too much for a 3 credit course. Don't expect a typical Econ course (it's different from any that I have taken thus far). I would recommend avoiding this class unless you need to take it.", 
            "My favorite professor at the university. Hard to get an A, easy to get a B, impossible to fail if you go to class. Teaches almost as much history as theory, little calculations, some memorization. Took class time to talk about current issues. responds to emails in 5 seconds if you have any questions. interesting class!", 
            "Worst professor in Economics department. Would not take a class with him again. Exams are not fair and do not test what is important in the course. Horrible lecturer and was very unhelpful during office hours. It is a shame that Professor Deardorff is the only one to teach Econ 340, because it could of been a great course.", 
            "Avoid him by all means. He gets lost in classes and takes weeks to finish marking papers. He's worse than the GSI",

The material itself is very interesting, as are his lectures, but his exams were far too specific and difficult, and there is a minimal curve. He says he wants to change the class, but doesn't listen. Just beware and prepared.", 
            "He is full of himself. Super boring, entertained trivial questions and comments that wasted class time. No wonder we never finished the powerpoints. Wants to know how to improve the course, but assures us he won't change it. Wish he would, this could have been a great course. Plus side: different tie every day."

            "Definitely recommend taking a class with him. He's funny, fair, and responds to email in a decent amount of time. He gives a lot to read, but it's doable if you manage your time. Projects and class discussions were fun and interesting.", 
            "The GSIs are harder to deal with than Professor Lampe himself. Coming in interested in SI, decided to drop it because of this course.", 
            "The GSI's are horrible graders, their feedback is not clear. I don't understand how they grade these assignments. Be prepared for a lot of reading and it will not be helpful for the quizzes. The lectures are very boring. It seems like a lot of the topics are random and do not connect to each other. I wouldn't take this class if not needed.", 
            "Professor Lampe stepped up after our previous professor couldn't teach anymore for personal reasons, and he's been nothing but fair and accommodating. Yes, there were quite a few readings but you really just had to skim them. The tests were also curved so as long as you put in a little effort you'd do well. The final project was also manageable.", 
            "AVOID. Too many readings. Too complex of readings. Project w/ absurd amount of work (expected to be 3500-4000 words/person in the group). does not respond to student concerns. tests are so hard (due to vagueness of class). seems like he's purposefully hard to be a cheeky U of M prof. annoyingly arrogant for someone from the west side of michigan.", 
            "Absurd amount of work. 100 + pages of reading per week. obscure pop quiz every week. 10 2-4 page essays, 2 projects equivalent to 10 page essay, another 2500 word essay. no assignments relate to actual material you need to know. will ruin your life. required to go to out of class lectures to complete essays. will be biggest regret of your life.", 
            "Absolutely terrible class. I was excited to explore the School of Information, and after taking this class I for sure will not pursue that interest. Guidelines for class are incredibly vague, the GSIs are hard graders. Expect to do an insane amount of reading and writing for this class. Lectures are EXTREMELY boring.", 
            "The readings each week are so long and the quizzes assess if you memorized word for word one sentence out of the readings. The grading system is extremely confusing and not explained, the projects are ridiculously long and uninteresting. Unless you want to major in information, don't take it. Way too much busy work, but not very hard overall.", 
            "There are weekly readings that are extremely boring and dry. Each week, there is a quiz over the boring readings. This class is \"gamified\" so grading is like a game with a leaderboard and points. The semester is almost over and I am just starting to understand how the grading works. Confusing. Boring. Awful. Pain in the ass. Dr. Lampe is very funny", 
            "Ironically, for a class built on gamification, this class is designed really poorly. Ten 2-4 page writing assignments (which you get little to no helpful feedback for your grade). 2 large projects, 1 semester-long project, weekly pop quizzes (on specific details from the 4 hours worth of reading), final exam. Don't take this. HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE", 
            "Cliff uses Gradecraft for his class - a program that attempts to turn an academic course at a major university into a video game. The course is structured in a way that is made to let students work at their own pace and instead the teacher drops all of the assignments on you at once. He has planned this class very poorly and I was jk about him hot",

On one hand, he fakes empathizing with students and claims he understands how busy we are, while at the same time gives us grief for not doing the readings for one week. Our midterm was a MONSTROSITY of a research paper (15 pages and 20-40 sources!!). Funny, good lecturer, field expert, hard af.", 
            "Honestly, did the class take some effort? Yes. Was the grading team evil and did everything to stop you from getting your precious A? No. Cliff was a great professor, always enthusiastic and funny, which made the material a breeze.

            "Took the class thinking it would be easy and fun, but the curriculum got super revamped. Crazy amount of readings and deadlines every week, which means crazy slow grading(literally 3 weeks) so you get feedback on what to improve after you hand in the next big assignment. Class is fun, but it was poorly revamped; it might change next semester.", 
            "He dramatically changed his class this year so most people get a B+. Even if you work really hard and do exactly what they ask for, they will give you an 88%. You also have to do immense amounts of readying and are quizzed on it weekly. Don't take this course unless you have to or are interested in the material and willing to get an average grade."

            "If you are a programmer, Kieras is one of the most knowledgeable professors you will ever meet. This class is no joke, but if you are willing to put in the time and effort to succeed, you will be well prepared for any future C++ work.", 
            "He is a good lecturer but his grading scheme makes competition fierce: your final score is the percentage of your actual score divided by the criterion score which is the average of the scores of the top four students. Therefore, in a semester when many coding experts take the course, good luck with your final grade. Be mentally prepared for that.", 
            "I spend two full nights for every project so the workload is okay for me. However, code refactoring takes the rest of my time because he grades coding style very harshly (sometimes so harshly that it seeems arbitrary). However, it is a VERY good experience that your code is criticized for poor quality while you are still in college!", 
            "Reading is required but you can skim some. Coding is heavy but I personally found the course easier than 445 because unlike machine learning, 381 does not require much math or even thinking (!). Just follow his coding standards very carefully and spend two full nights doing a project using some visual debugger (XCode speeds up things a lot).", 
            "VERY VERY HEAVY WORKLOAD. Plan your other courses accordingly if you wish to take this class. You will learn how to be a great programmer, but you need to devote the time right from the beginning. Kieras really does not mess around. Don't expect any sympathy from him if you get a failing grade from him the semester you expect to graduate.", 
            "One of the toughest classes at this university, but is implicitly REQUIRED for CS majors. You will realize that you are not a good programmer before completing this class. There are reading assignments for this class, believe it or not. Be warned: you need to work very hard right from the beginning in order to do well. Do not fall behind.", 
            "If you can be part time and take just this class, that's the best way to go. It is easy to underestimate how much work is given in this class. On the other hand, it is important for every CS major to know the material taught in this class. Kieras may make you feel bad about yourself when you get your projects back, but you really will learn a lot.", 
            "Not really tough content, but heaviest workload ever. It is nearly impossible to take this course with another course. However, what you learn in this course is important for every CS major to know. In my opinion, any CS major who graduates without having taken this course is incompetent. You really are not a good programmer until you have done so.", 
            "Kieras will turn you into a great programmer after taking this course, make sure you are mentally prepared. It is a lot of work. Also, don't take this course your last semester here. Kieras won't have any mercy on you if you all of a sudden can't graduate because of this course. If you could be part time and take just this course, that would help.", 
            "Professor Kieras will not take any BS. You can vaguely describe an issue and he will understand what the problem is. If haven't tried everything or read the directions enough he will not be willing to help. Extremely clear in his handout and amazing class.", 
            "Be warned that the workload for this class is insane. It won't take you long to realize that you are not a good programmer without taking this class. Make sure you are mentally prepared to take this class though. It's really as much work as rumors suggest. Kieras is very strict with all his rules and does not allow anybody to negotiate grades.", 
            "This class has the heaviest workload at this university. The rumors are all true. However, you will learn a lot from Kiera. Your projects will be returned coated in red pen. All CS majors should be required to take this class. I think many people would find it more accommodating if this class could be split into two semesters.", 
            "By far the best teacher I have ever had. That said, it's the most work a class has ever given to me. Long hours on projects but the tests are not as bad as EECS 281. You will be a master of C++ after this course though.", 
            "Pros: He assigns book reports on reading assignments, which are a good thing if you formerly had a bad habit of not reading textbooks and are trying to change. The projects require a lot of code and a lot of thought, but no strict optimizing like 281. Cons: He grades projects extremely harsh and is generally unhelpful in office hours.", 
            "I really liked the class, mostly for the material and not as much for the prof. However, Kieras really is very helpful (and knows A LOT)! Go to his OH for project help, read his handouts, review the lecture notes, and set aside large amounts of time to code. I didn't find the class difficult, but it is certainly time-consuming.", 
            "Not what I expected. Very useful, though not apparent to most students why. The course is poorly named; it's about writing maintainable code with good style, and it pays huge dividends in industry. Kieras is pretty boring and lecture had few surprises for me, his handouts are some of the best resources *on the internet*. High workload, easy tasks.", 
            "I found this course incredibly helpful. People who complain that his grading is too tough or that he only teaches you his preferred style of coding miss the point. The real purpose of the class in my mind is to give you a solid framework from which to view programming and to introduce you to essential concepts of object-oriented programming.", 
            "Very comprehensive and challenging class, but that's why people take it. If you know what you're getting yourself into, then you can definitely appreciate Kieras. He really is an awesome prof.", 
            "Prof Kieras is one of the most knowledgeable teachers at this university BY FAR! It seems that he has been working with computers since they were created and knows every little intricacy to the language. He is extremely willing to help u if u ask for it. This class teaches you EVERYTHING about c++. Without it I feel like I would know nothing.", 
            "he has a criterion system in grading which is not helpful at all. he does not run curve and he does not allow you to negotiate over your grades."

            "Professor Markovits is one of the most intelligent professors I have had in my four years at Michigan. I could not have enjoyed his lectures more than I did, the class was full of sports history as well as general history. Each lecture was perfectly planned and fluid, it felt as though you were reading a story about sports over time!", 
            "Totally worth taking all of his classes, even if you know nothing about the subject going in. You'll learn a lot.", 
            "An incredible professor and model of what a teacher should be! A fantastic lecturer, mentor, and all around human. My best experience at Michigan. Take his classes!", 
            "The best professor I have had at Michigan! Highly recommend taking one of his courses!", 
            "Professor Markovits is engaging, accessible, passionate, and essentially a walking encyclopedia with regard to his class topics. Highly recommend any of his classes. This one was very challenging (hence the 400 designation) but I came away with a new appreciation for German politics and the German Left's history.", 
            "Brilliant lecturer who really tries to make you understand the subject matter. Listens to your point of view without the slightest hint on condescension. A real life changer.", 
            "Professor Markovits is a rare professor who is incredibly brilliant, but also deeply cares about his students and their engagement and understanding of the course material. He provides thorough comments on all papers and he is focused on improving everyone's writing ability. His lectures are well-organized and interesting! Loved going to class.", 
            "Professor Markovits is one of the rare professors who is incredibly brilliant, but also deeply cares about his students and their understanding of the course material. He is very fair and provides thorough comments on all essays. His lectures are engaging and well-organized. I left every lecture amazed at all of the things I'd just learned!", 
            "Professor Markovits is an incredible professor. He is not only knowledgeable about the topic but also passionate about teaching it well. He is also caring and eager to help students outside of class to understand complex historical processes. His anecdotes are priceless and advice is incredibly helpful for young scholars. Highly recommended!!", 
            "Andy is the most intelligent and involved professor I have encountered at the University of Michigan. His encyclopedic knowledge of everything and his contagious enthusiasm for the topics he covers are inspirational. More importantly, though, he is a strong advocate for his students both before and after graduation. Absolutely amazing!", 
            "Prof Markovits had such a profound impact on me at that decades later I still reflect back on his fascism class (I marked course \"494\" though it was actually at Wesleyan). His depth of knowledge & urgent enthusiasm was unmatched. He revealed the very specific contexts and dynamics necessary for fascism to arise. Masterful, colorful & enduring.", 
            "It's not often that us students are gifted with a professor who not only has an impeccable array of knowledge on a plethora of topics such as Markovits, but who also have a genuine interest in bestowing that knowledge upon future generations. Andrei is a mentor and does everything he can to help me succeed, even outside the classroom context.", 
            "Professor Markovits' lectures are heavy (hard work, attend lectures). He also recommended me for MIW. I'm so thankful that told me about it and that he was so active in helping me succeed here. I was incredibly lucky to have had a professor who cares so much about his students and is passionate about teaching us.", 
            "Held a great discussion section in which we discussed sports for an hour each week. Very intelligent and well versed in all different aspects of sports. Heavily recommend if you are looking for an interesting class on sports and culture. Lectures were very insightful and provided tons of information that were both useful in class and real life.", 
            "Markovits is the quintessential university professor. His knowledge of content, in this case the German political system, was contagious in the classroom. He respects academic risk takers and will always keep an open door to discuss the course and any academic thought you have. He mentored me closely in my time at UM and beyond. Take his course.", 
            "Professor Markovits is an amazing professor - his Germany after 1945 class is maybe my favorite I've taken at Michigan. He is exhaustively knowledgeable on the subjects he teaches, and in lecture he asks the class questions which keeps it engaging. If you go to office hours and put time in to develop the relationship he can be an excellent mentor.", 
            "I loved Professor Markovits' class. He has such passion for the subject (sports in this case but also political science in general) that you can't help but love learning what he's teaching. He's very knowledgeable and clearly has a wealth of experience but also is very open to learning from his students and encourages them to think for themselves.", 
            "Professor Markovits was a phenomenal instructor. He was incredibly knowledgable on so many subjects and kept lectures interested throughout the course. He also allowed me to work on a research paper with him, which I found to be a very valuable experience.", 
            "Professor Markovits is incredibly knowledgeable and can offer real experiences to further illustrate what he is describing. He is able to make connections between topics and fields that brings out the significance of the course content. He is also very caring and invested in his students. Would (and am) take again.", 
            "Professor Markovits is an absolutely amazing lecturer and a brilliant mind. The best class I have taken so far at Michigan! Extremely thought-provoking and creative, this class expands your thinking and writing abilities exponentially. My GSI and section was amazing, in which helped bring the whole class together. Highly recommend!"

            "If you show up to class and read the textbook you'll be fine. Sometimes forgets to cover what is in the textbook and the material will show up on the exam. Can be tough to understand what she is explaining when in a 300-student lecture. Very clear when you ask a question at office hours though", 
            "Class was ridiculously difficult regardless of professor, but Biteen did not help much. She is obviously very qualified and knows the information but does not convey it well. Class is fine until exams, which are made unrealistically difficult.", 
            "While I recognize Professor Biteen's skill and knowledge in the field of chemistry. I personally was not ever blown away by her lectures, or her explanations of the subject. She is a perfectly fine lecturer, and you will learn what you need to learn, but don't expect to be excited for every lecture.", 
            "Chem 130 is honestly just an annoying class. I felt it was designed to make it harder to succeed. Prof. Biteen's iClicker questions were pretty easy, but she made a lot of mistakes in lecture. Additionally, her lecture notes got less useful as the semester went on. She seems to be a nice person but I didn't think she was the best lecturer.", 
            "If you are looking for an easy A, do NOT take Chem130 unless you have to. If you cannot avoid the course, take it with Professor Biteen because she is good at explaining difficult concepts.", 
            "Biteen makes a lot of mistakes during lecture, but she almost always lets the class redo the iClicker questions until a majority gets it right. Otherwise she was nice, much better than the other professors. Exams tore everyone a new one though.", 
            "Here's the deal. You're probably taking Chem 130 because you have to and Biteen is a perfectly fine professor to take it with. It's a challenging class and the lectures are pretty vanilla, but if you're decent at Chemistry you should get at least a B. You want Bartlett if you can get him, but Biteen is a solid backup.", 
            "She's kind and will answer all of your questions. She occasionally makes no sense and often confuses her words, but if you point it out or go to her office hours, she clarifies. Very sweet and caring, makes cute little jokes here and there.", 
            "Biteen is the best! She structures her lectures and the discussions so well, you cannot help but do great! She is really funny and really loves her students. Could not recommend her more highly!", 
            "Very sweet and caring. She goes at a pretty reasonable pace and is very open to helping people with questions so the lectures and iClickers were fairly easy for me (I had some previous experience with chem honors in high school). The tests are a little challenging though and aren't curved.", 
            "Dr. Biteen has it together! Extremely available for student needs outside of class. I met with her literally every week outside of office hours to ask questions and talk material. Obviously loves her students and wants them to succeed.", 
            "Makes at least 3 mistakes per lecture. Feels like she was a high school teacher with a class average of a C- and was pulled up to the bug leagues and can't handle the pressure.", 
            "You have to show up to every class because you must answer iClicker questions for a grade at every lecture, and it only counts if you go to your assigned lecture, you can't go to another and answer the questions there. Biteen is woefully unprepared, barely knows how to use PowerPoint, many of her iClicker questions are wrong.", 
            "She's new to U of M, but she seems to know her stuff. She goes through the basic chem slides all the other teachers go through as well. She was very nice and is willing to answer questions. iClicker attendance is recommended since they can give you an extra 4% boost in the class. Exams are actually pretty hard though since she doesn't write them.", 
            "She just reads off the slides in lecture and this isn't very good if you ask me. She also has an odd sense of humor", 
            "Julie's lectures are very helpful and she prepares you well for the exams. The exams are a bit tricky so you will have to do a lot of practice problems like she recommends. Tends to make lame jokes often and overuse the phrase \"sanity check\". Overall, very helpful and clear professor, would recommend.", 
            "Not a terrible professor but tended to just read off her generic powerpoints during lecture. Really nice person and helpful during office hours. If you can get Sipowska, take her instead. Sipowska writes the tests and her section typically did better on the exams.", 
            "Although Gen Chem is not an easy class, Professor Biteen is a great teacher who cares a lot about her students. She explains very clearly and really wants to make sure everyone understands. Go to her office hours early on, she is very helpful and understanding.", 
            "Professor Biteen is a great chemistry professor. She is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about chemistry. She goes through the chapters at a good pace. The exams are very hard, but you can do well by doing lot's of practice problems from the book and that are provided online.", 
            "Professor Biteen is one of my favorite professors i've had. She is extremely enthusiastic and cares so much about all her students. She always makes sure every understands concepts before moving on. Exams are difficult but if you do a lot of practice you can do well. If you're going to take this class, take it with Professor Biteen."

He is also very montonous- try to stay awake! His exams are fair, but very short on time. Better be fluent with the material and well prepared!", 
            "One of the best professors I have had at UMICH. The lectures are very interesting and there are 3 HW problems each week that require a lot of work. Exams were very easy, he said in class \"I don't give hard exams because I don't want to grade gibberish!\"", 
            "Barber is by far one of the best profs I have had here. He gives you the information you need to solve problems both in class and in a job. The homeworks were usually three problems and took a fair amount of time but were good practice for the exam. The exam itself is straightforward and there were never ridiculous questions that made everyone fail",

            "Amazing guy! This professor comes with bare hand but with all the stuffs in his head. His lecture is very clear and logical, you do not want to miss a single class since every word he said could be in the homework or exam. One bad thing is that the homework is sometimes difficult, driving people crazy. Overall, a great professor that I ever met.", 
            "He's fantastic. His lectures are clear, he encourages student participation and cares about whether or not his students understand the material. The homework is difficult but it's based on the lecture notes, and if you do your homework in the learning center you can get help from other students so it's completely manageable.",

            "Barber is on of the best professors I've ever had. People complain because he doesn't use notes during lecture, but that doesn't matter. If you copy down what he writes on the board you essentially will have a statics textbook by the end of he semester. Study the lecture notes and homeworks and you will do fine on the exams.",

Luckily, ME 211 is a class you can self-study and still do fairly well, because the lectures really don't help you learn the material. Homeworks are long and tedious. Exams aren't horrible.",

Got an A-", 
            "His lectures at times might be confusing and he does make a couple of mistakes when doing example problems. He teaches straight from the book. He is really helpful when you go to him for one on one time. So if you do not get a particular theory you should go ask him during office hours.", 
            "He's an interesting character. Always claims that he isn't out to trick you yet on the exams, he comes up with all sorts of tricks. It's almost if he utilizes reverse psychology to reduce the avg grade in the class. He utilizes all 50 mins during the exam very well. If you take one second to think about how hard the exam is, you've already failed.",

Homework is quite challenge and require deep understanding of class material. Lots of times should put on presentation & report. Anyway, this is a good and useful class for VLSI student and requires nontrivial work.",

Furthermore, EECS 423 is a pretty good course that can give you both the theatrical understanding and hands-on clean room experience for the MOSFET fabrication and characteristic. This is the course that you only can take in Michigan!",

The best thing you learn from Proff. Kanicki in this class is the future of semiconductor electronics. He will show you countless areas to do groundbreaking discoveries and innovations.", 
            "In all, EECS 523 covers a lot of material from device to technology, and Professor Kanicki's lecture was clear and helpful. Test was not so hard, but you need to always actively participate in class, and read more after class. I really enjoyed talking with him after class.", 
            "I really liked Prof. Kanicki's testing style. His tests are purely based on conceptual understanding of device physics, rather than derivations or calculations. This made learning fun. He believes in bridging the gap between academia and industry. So he talks about latest happenings in the industry during lectures.",

There is no course project as such, but we had to give a 30min talk about topics relevant to the subject but not covered in the course. I believe this course is useful and Prof. Kanicki's discussions keeping industrial and academic viewpoint is a boon.",

The kind of discussions that were held during the class intrigued me to read further on the upcoming technologies in the semi-conductor industry. He is deeply motivated and takes great pain to make the subject as simple as possible to explain.", 
            "Prof. Kanicki is an excellent instructor overall, he tried to balance theoretical and applied concepts in his teaching while also bringing up historical and contemporary events to bring a sense of relevancy to what we were learning. He did get on tangents with some regularity, but the topics and his personality made them alright.", 
            "He is a very good instructor who really cares about the students and teach useful materials. I recommend taking this course", 
            "You do not need the textbook if you attend the lecture. In lecture he teaches for the lab and how industry views the device fabrication. I enjoyed his talks about industry, others didn't. He will tell you what general topics will be on the exam. The clean room part of the class was great. You get to develop, test, and then keep the wafer.", 
            "Good professor and nice class. Writing reports takes time but the grading criteria are very clear.", 
            "I especially enjoyed his tangents during lecture.", 
            "While this class doesn't have HW or Exams, active participation and constant communication are key. Start the projects early and always talk to him about your progress. IF you do this, he will be very helpful in helping you improve your projects. If you don't go to class and wait until the end to start your projects, it is not an \"easy A\".", 
            "Very clear about grading and expectations. Lecture slides are clear and readable., and is very related to cleanroom labs, which is not very common among other EE classes.", 
            "professor also relate the knowledge to his own story, which is interesting and helpfull.", 
            "An inspiring teacher who not only knows a lot about his own field, but also keeps interest in other engineering/world news. His classes open with either a hot engineering topic of the week or a moral/ethical lesson, which is always interesting. If you attend the class, you would never need to open the textbook.", 
            "EECS 512 is a good class if you want to learn about thin film semiconductor devices. Professor Kanicki also allows students to concentrate on particular devices through the individual report and this a great opportunity to learn about something new that a student may be particularly interested in.", 
            "EECS 512 is an excellent course to gain a strong working knowledge about thin-film semiconductor devices and a variety of their applications (i.e. metal-oxide-based and a-Si TFT's, solar cells, and detectors). Though there may not be problem sets and exams, the course projects will be extensive and you will learn a great deal. A's are not free.", 
            "Kanicki is a good professor; my only complaint is that at times he jumped into numbers and the engineering side of things too quickly and sped through derivations and the underlying physics and chemistry. I really liked the project-based nature of the class, it was a nice change of pace from the typical homework, test, and final formula."

            "Professor Malone is EXTREMELY helpful; while she isn't the most exciting lecturer, she explains things quite clearly and fields questions often, even in the lecture of a few hundred kids. Is fantastic in office hours, so I definitely recommend attending those if you need help. Textbook use isn't mandatory, but I thought it was quite useful.",

            "Professor Malone is one of the best professors I've had in my life. Definitely the professor you want for 101 as she is very helpful and extremely clear in lectures. Attendance via iClickers in lecture (for extra credit) and 3 exams and 4 section quizzes. Exams are somewhat difficult, but manageable, especially with practice exams.", 
            "Malone is a GOD! Her lectures are interesting, and she is an overall awesome person. She's very intelligent and is very willing to give help to her students. The tests are somewhat difficult but if you go to office hours and review sessions you should be fine!",

            "The best econ professor at UoM. Not an easy class for sure and AP econ does not help at all.Its more \"applications of economics.\" What you learn in class and the book is not what you are tested on. You need to be a master of those skills to do well, which is what some people get confused about with this course. Get Malone...you will be fine",

            "George is a great guy. Proud to say I was among the last couple classes he taught at U of M. He truly cares and I think a reason he stopped teaching was because not enough of his students felt the same.", 
            "Great Professor! I loved his first year writing class- much less analytical than most others. He's really helpful in office hours, and really makes you think about different ways to write essay. If you like to write, you won't regret this class.", 
            "Taking this class will make you a better writer ONLY because you have to write a lot. NOT because he is a good teacher. Although not a hard grader, the class is WAY more work than another 124/125 class (read 5 books and 8 papers). Do yourself a favor and get another class. No clarity and the syllabus is a joke. Don't take 125 with him.", 
            "he's very flexible and has very open-ended ramblings but i absolutely loved his class. at times pretty funny and unpredictable. he loves when you participate in discussions and his assignments are sometimes vague, which can be good because it gives students a lot of room to express themselves freely.",

            "i kinda disagree with those other comments. i think hes a really interesting and thought-provoking guy. yes, his assignments are vague and he has a weird style, but i definitely think i got something out of the class. he lets you re-do any paper and throws out the old grade which is amazing.", 
            "No matter how good your essay may be, he will find reason to give you a bad grade. His style is ridiculous and he never gives directions worth following. It is not worth your time.", 
            "The assignments are so vague and he seems to pick favorites. For some people he writes TONS of comments and for others none. Will often give a good OR bad grade with no explanation. While he allows re-dos, he is often useless at office hours. He even said to a friend of mine \"you're wrong\" about how she described her spirituality. Very vague.", 
            "i wasn't sure what to expect in this class, but i think george accomplished what he set out to do. i learned a lot about interacting with people in the role of a tutor. also, swc 300 fulfills UM's ULWR and we had one 5pg paper and one 8-10pg paper. assignments were very self-directed, which can come off as vague, but i enjoyed them.", 
            "He seems easy-going at first, but he gets really whiny and moody with no apparent cause at times. He also gives extremely vague assignments and then whines because we didn't meet his apparently exact standards. Pretty easy but really pointless class.", 
            "Could've done a better job with the class",

Sometimes the readings and discussions are dry and painful but when it comes to papers you can write about anything. He gives you a lot of freedom and you'll probably enjoy a new type of writing.",

Instead I felt discouraged and uninspired.",

She was eager to help us and was reasonable with deadlines. Only issue: nothing's really graded except your portfolio at the end of the term, so that's nerve-wracking.",

So glad I had her.",

            "I agree with the other reviewers for the most part, but especially towards the end of the year, she tended to explain less why things actually work the way they do, which made them make less sense. If you don't care about that, then she's one of the best. Excellent otherwise.",

            "Lectures were relatively uninteresting and fast-paced, but slides were posted online. Ezra cares about the material, and my GSI was more than willing to clarify answers. Workload was minimal and there were 5 HW assignments and two online, timed, open-note exams. That said, study for these or you'll run out of time. An easy A.", 
            "Easy class, take it!", 
            "Professor Ezra is great. Nice guy and an easy A, but a lot of the information is dry if you have no interest for Linguistics. Five homework assignments and two exams. All the information you need is in his PowerPoints, so lecture is sometimes pretty pointless. Regardless, go to lecture. And trust me, don't bother getting the textbook.", 
            "Ezra is my favorite professor I've had here. He is so funny and so adorable. The work load of this class was insanely light and the lectures were fun and engaging.", 
            "Ezra is really nice and he cares a lot about what he teaches but it's honestly a really boring class - in part I think it might have been because of my boring GSI, but it really was horribly boring. It was still a very, very easy class with a really minimal workload, though.", 
            "Easiest course in years. No papers, no exams, can get by without doing the reading. Also manages to be interesting from time to time! Keshet's a super nice guy too. Some overlap with CS topics from 203, 376, 492 (but not in as much depth). Highly recommended, and not just because I found it easy.", 
            "Ezra is a nice guy, but the class is terrible. It's a struggle to stay focused (or stay awake) during lecture, and he doesn't always explain the concepts very clearly. Homework is just readings from the textbook and a few online assignments. Overall it's a pretty light workload, but the material is very boring.", 
            "He is very helpful and friendly. The class is very interactive that we always have discussion towards several topics.", 
            "Ezra is sort of adorable. He's one of the most friendly professors I've had yet, and he puts a lot of effort into being fair. If you're interested in linguistics, I would certainly recommend him.", 
            "This was the very first Linguistics course I've ever taken and Prof. Keshet helped me the entire way! He's quick to answer emails and to make appointments to help you out. One of the most devoted instructors I've ever encountered!", 
            "Ezra is very knowledgable about what he teaches, this class is apart of his field of study. There are no exams or papers, just problem sets, attendance/participation and reading quizzes. This class is very easy to pass if you go to class and pay attention. He gives you time in class to work on the problem sets and answers any questions. Great guy!", 
            "Professor Keshet obviously knows the material very well and tries his best to make it interesting. He is also pretty good at explaining the material in a clear way. However, linguistics is really really boring, although this really isn't the professor's fault at all. It's an easy class but pretty dry.", 
            "This class is not difficult at all. As long as you do the homework and study at least a little, you'll do fine. Prof Keshet is very helpful and genuinely wants you to do well. He explains things thoroughly and wants you to do well.", 
            "I love this professor. :D He's wonderfully excitable and fun to listen to. We get out early a lot and he's really helpful when the subject is somewhat difficult. We spent 15 minutes watching videos of baby pandas sneezing this semester for an example. I had him for LING 111 too and he was okay, but teaching for a big lecture is really different!"

He seems to genuinely care about teaching so students understand, and this is reflected in his unique grading rubric. Put in the effort and the \"bonus\" points take much of the pressure off of the final. Gives excellent, concise explanations. Wish I was taking his class for calc1!",

His teaching methods are very clear of what to expect. If you failed a question on exams/quizzes he offers 18 bonus points if you can prove to him you understand the concept", 
            "Professor Rad is a good guy, cares for his students, and really does try to help students. Test are hard and homework takes time. He tries new methods of teaching and grading which can make things confusing. But I respect it because he is trying to make the class success rate go up instead of going with the status quo.", 
            "I took his class as a senior in high school and thought he was an excellent teacher. He was thorough in his explanations, always giving multiple paths to success. I had difficulty with labs and he was flexible and worked with me to finish them. Very responsive with WebWork, will take points off written work. Exams were fair, would highly recommend.",

If you value understanding, then take him!", 
            "Gives homework at least three times a week.... Expects way too much for a math lecture class... Left no time for studying actual material, and was unclear on directions. Expect labs and projects, and endless homework that is too difficult to do based on his notes.", 
            "Professor Radosevich is a very amazing person and a great teacher. Be prepared to be treated like a college student because you will have to work for a good grade. Presentations and homework are the best practice. He likes challenging his students. Talk to him if you need anything, he'll help any way he can. I would definitely take him again.",

I just wish he cut down the Webwork a bit and take off the labs and projects to actually leave some time to study for his hard tests- he likes to test your knowledge, not computations :/", 
            "Really nice guy but very unorganized when it came to teaching. Lectures were helpful sometimes but we wasted half of semester doing presentations on book problems once a week. His exams were fairly easy with the exception of a challenging final exam. The online HW is ridiculous for the first half but got easier as the semester went on.", 
            "His organizational skills are on point. However his lectures are not simplified and are difficult to understand if you have never taken calculus before. He is not afraid to take points off of the written homework and his exams are pretty difficult. You have to put in A LOT of work to get a decent grade. I would take someone else....", 
            "Great professor, easily one of the best in the mathematics department I have had. Lectures are very detailed, but also formatted and organized in a clear way. If you want to pass, do the homework, but also use outside resources (e.g. Khan academy). Overall challenging course but a lenient professor. Tests did get progressively harder.", 
            "He's insanely smart. The lectures go so fast, so you should definitely read the chapter before class so you have an idea where he's going. Use the MLC, Khan Academy and do more than just the homework problems he assigns.",

However, I personally did not like his teaching style. I had to self teach myself the class. We had online homework, written homework, tests, labs (free points basically), and gateway exams.",

At the same time, I found the class to be not what I expected - there is no discussion or anything, it's basically you reading the text he assigns and then on exams proving that you understand the reading...doesn't allow much room for your own interpretation, which to me is important"

            "Psych230 with Dr. Cummings was one of my favorite classes! The material was interesting and challenging, but manageable. And you have to actually understand things for the exams so it takes some studying, but its not tricky. Definitely worth it!", 
            "Dr. Cummings was a good instructor, although she explained certain topics better than others and had a tendency to rush through certain topics. She was open to questions and answered them well, and you could tell she wanted us to do well. Exams were long, but they were never tricky and were a fair representation of material covered in lecture.", 
            "The course is not hard but the Prof does not explain all the material. Workload heavy. Exam are mostly long answer questions. I understood the material very well but the GSI took points of for almost every question just because I didnt have time to construct the language (im not a native speaker).", 
            "Good intro class. Difficult material but it was explained clearly. Went to professor and GSI office hours and both were really helpful. Tests are challenging but fair. Would definitely take a class with Dr. Cummings again.", 
            "Hilarious that everyone is complaining about how hard it wasdid you even study, bro? Because my friends and I did and we all received As. Dr. Cummings is great and the material was presented and tested fairly. If you think it was too hard, you may want to reconsider Neuroscience as a field. Or suck it up.", 
            "If you thought this class was hard, grow up. It is not nearly as bad as biochem just saying. The material is relevant, interesting, and applicable. Exams are more than fair. It tests key concepts while memorizing specific nomenclature is not necessary. Grading is VERY fair 70/30 Lecture/Discussion. Thank you Professor Cummings (& the amazing GSIs)!", 
            "Professor Cummings course was really difficult because there was no guidance for any of the exams!!", 
            "This is too much work for an introductory course and I completed ALL of my upper level courses with much more ease than this. There is so much material and there is no guidance on what is and is not important. The exams, don't let her lie to you, are almost majority free response. There are no study guides or quality review sessions.", 
            "This class was extremely challenging for a gateway BCN course. We received no guidance or study guide for the exams, and the exams were ten pages of free response. When students shared concerns about the level of difficulty, the professor was unwilling to negotiate or curve tests. So much information and such little direction (especially from GSIs)", 
            "Loved taking 331 with Dr. Cummings. The Lab I was in was super fun, and even though the writing part was a lot of work it totally wasnt bad for a ULWR. Definitely recommend! :)", 
            "This class is not bad at all. Study by reviewing lectures and it's an easy A. The concepts taught in this class are all very dumbed down and simple.", 
            "I have Intro Biopsych with Dr. Cummings and its awesome. Theres for sure a ton of work but her lectures are great and put together in a really understandable way. Its also clear she actually cares how we do and focuses a lot on studying and study techniques, which is really nice. Challenging, but worth it.", 
            "Dr. Cummings is super sweet and also really funny. However, her exams are a bit ridiculous. She doesn't give any guidelines as to what you should be studying (her answer is everything) and its SO much information which makes it nearly impossible to memorize every detail, but if you don't memorize everything then you won't do well on exams", 
            "the class is definitely more work than you'd expect for a psych 200 level, but overall she's a good lecturer and the exams were fair (but long)", 
            "too much material. The professor does not go over everything in the lecture but everything is on the test. There are three test, one writing assignment, a final project, a journal club, and a anatomy practical. Just think it's too much work for a 200 level class. Btw, she's not willing to curve at all and she said she'd only curve down.", 
            "Professor Cummings was such a great professor. She was super articulate and explained everything in detail and is clearly and expert in the subject. She was super enthusiastic and personable which was refreshing. Grading was a little harder than expected but not too bad.", 
            "Wasn't looking forward to this class because I thought it would be all molecular brain stuff but it was actually good. Prof Cummings is a great teacher and makes things really clear, plus she's pretty funny. Definitely a good class.", 
            "Just finished Sex Differences with Dr. Cummings and it was amazing! Cool range of info from biological contributions to social factors for a bunch of stuff I've never even considered before. She actually encourages discussion in class and even though some students can get off topic, it was actually fun. Definitely a good prof!", 
            "Professor Cummings really cares about her students. She will meet with you whenever you need to answer all of your questions. Her exams are challenging, but if you study and understand the material, then you will do well! There are no surprises in this class, and the information is actually super cool!", 
            "Tests for this class felt a little ridiculous. You are basically expected to memorize EVERYTHING from the class slides. You will be tested on around half of it, but she doesn't provide any study guides. Overall, this was a needlessly stressful class of which I forgot most of what i \"learned\" because it was just memorization. Honestly, I hated it."

            "Good lecturer - clear, even-paced, organized. Has question of the day (might be on exam), so attendance is recommended. Exams are HARD. Not enough to just memorize; exams are composed of \"application\" questions to test your understanding. Very reasonable regarding re-grades. Textbook not necessary but good for clarification.", 
            "This class was so hard! He might be nice, but he definitely isn't easy. Tests are very applied and the class is curved to a B-/C+. Class is almost all CMB majors because they are required to take it and no one else wants to kill their GPA. MCDB 427 and 428 are the reasons why CMB is one of the hardest majors at UM.

His exams are not blow off though, you do have to study quite a bit. But none the less if you wana Bio prof, this is your guy. If he is teaching get into his class.",

            "Hands down the best class I've taken. Jeremy is a gem at the U. Get ready to read a lot (for the most part, it's great stuff from the New Yorker, Atlantic, Harpers), get real deep in class, read some good writing from your classmates and get a lot feedback. It's a lot of work, but Jeremy will make you a better writer, guaranteed!", 
            "Jeremy is incredible. He is enthusiastic, engaging, and forces his students to think bigger in their analysis. If you read (the books are worth reading) and engage in class you will love him! I go to his office hours now just to say hello because he is such a good guy. He is a hard grader though, but participation goes a long way.", 
            "Jeremy is very kind and considerate to his students. He helped me improve my writing greatly. There is a lot of reading, but it is possible to do well and not to read all of the assigned books. I would definitely recommend Jeremy, I came out of his class a stronger student.", 
            "Jeremy's a helpful, fun instructor who keeps the topic of discussion flowing, relevant and revelatory!", 
            "Jeremy is a great professor, he's fun and engaging. He's incredibly helpful during class and office hours. Definitely a good deal of reading", 
            "Loved Jeremiah's class. Probably the best professor I've had at Michigan so far. The lectures are really discussion-based and there were a lot of readings but they were mostly enjoyable! Definitely take a class with Professor Chamberlin if you get a chance!!", 
            "Hands down the most amazing teacher I have ever had at the University of Michigan. Cares deeply about his students, is extremely intelligent, witty and interesting. Teaches great material. Genuinely invested in improving your writing abilities and seeing you succeed. Literally such a gem of the English Department.", 
            "Do not take a class with Jeremy if you don't plan on doing all the reading, and there is a LOT of it. He abides by the rule that for every credit hour, you should have 3 hours of work per week, so a 3 credit class with him is 9 hours of readingessay writing a week. But, he's pretty cool and the class was relatively enjoyable. Not my fav, but good.", 
            "This class was an absolute pleasure. I was terrified to take it as I'd heard that a lot of the professors were really tough, unclear graders. However this has by far been my favorite class. Jeremy is not only clear but truly cares about his students. Class was always discussion based. Gives great feedback. Would love to take another class with him.", 
            "Great class with a great teacher! If you are willing to put the time in, you will be able to be successful. Also he makes English a class that makes sense, he doesn't over analyze books or kill the plot. Instead, he helps you look at the text at a different angle. My essay writing has dramatically improved.Take the class, you wont be disappointed!", 
            "Jeremiah is by far my favorite instructor I've had so far in my college career. He is great at facilitating discussion so that it is still student led, and he is very helpful and encouraging. His grading is tough but fair; receiving an A on a paper from him is so rewarding! I'd highly recommend this professor.", 
            "I was debating on taking course during the summer term because of the amount of books that we had to read in 8 weeks but Jeremiah made the class and material engaging! Definitely recommend this professor for Eng 298", 
            "Jeremy is super helpful and truly works to create a comfortable and engaging class environment. He can connect with anyone about any topic and is very personable.", 
            "Jeremy is a really great professor. I had heard great things and talked to him before, but I was really astounded by how effectively he ran the class. I improved my writing a lot, enjoyed a great class community, and felt engaged with the material throughout. Easily one of the most fulfilling English classes I've taken at the University.", 
            "Jeremy is the best ever. He's a really tough grader, but he'll work with you to really improve your writing. He's funny, makes class interesting, and really genuinely cares about his students. Best of all, he has a ton of connections in the publishing industry. Take a class with him if you can!", 
            "Probably the best English professor I've had in my four years at the University. He's funny, warm, encouraging, passionate, and experienced in his field. He knows how to make the classroom atmosphere a comfortable one, and every discussion is somehow stimulating AND fun.", 
            "If you can take any class with this guy, do it. He is inspiring, funny, helpful and incredibly thoughtful. His class inspired my career: I knew what I wanted to do but he opened my eyes to so many possibilities and made me more passionate about writing than I ever had been before. You'll never find a professor who cares as much as Chamberlin does.", 
            "Jeremiah is more concerned with puffing up his own ego than teaching his students and is prone to going on at length about topics which have nothing to do with the class. This course was advertised as one having to do with literary theory, but Jeremiah left students to figure out the theory on their own. If you can take 298 with anyone else, do so.", 
            "Don't let the lukewarm reviews fool you - Jeremy is an AMAZING professor! He is incredibly invested in his students and works hard to make sure everyone learns. If you feel overwhelmed or confused, e-mail him or go to office hours, he will help you. He's also super kind and hilarious, and classes are always fun. Easily my favorite class so far.",

Extremely unorganized, skips around the ppt slides, very slow in getting through the EASY material (lewis structures) and leaves far too little time for hard stuff.",

            "Professor Sharp is a horrible, terrible teacher. He makes an uncountable number of mistakes on his powerpoint presentations, old exams, handouts, etc, such that you will spend the vast majority of your study time trying to figure out his mistakes. If there were a solid textbook in the class, it wouldnt be bad--but there isnt; the text sucks too.",

            "Wow, what a guy. Like others have said, he's an amazing, engaging lecturer and really cares about his students. Very understanding and helpful. I hope to take another class with him. I can't recommend him enough.", 
            "Took this class due to it being one of the few polisci classes open still at the time of registration and had no real interest in Russia. Professor Suny changed that so much. Amazing professor, amazing man, one of the few who is so intelligent and passionate about what they teach", 
            "Professor Suny is one of the most intelligent professors I have had. His lectures are very clear and he provides great detail. The only negatives in this class are the guest lectures (though some were helpful) and the huge amounts of reading (100+ at times). If you go to lecture, take good notes, and read the assigned book, you will be fine.", 
            "I came into this class basically knowing nothing about Soviet history, which really worried me. However, Ron is an awesome guy--super friendly and helpful and as long as you do the reading and write good essays for the exams, it's not at all hard to do well. Warning: you do have a TON of reading to do and have to do it. Overall, great class!", 
            "Prof Suny is fantastic, his lectures were interesting, and I loved when he would go off course and tell the class a personal story. He's a surprisingly lenient grader, my papers weren't deep but I did just fine by reading just enough to form an argument in my papers. If you don't fully read the books, show up to class and get the lecture notes.", 
            "he babbles a lot so it's easy to get distracted. his powerpoints were mainly just pictures and him talking about something related to that picture or not. It was hard to follow along if you got distracted for a bit.", 
            "Great professor who's clearly very passionate about the subject. He is genuinely interested in getting to know every one of his students and doesn't mind dissenting opinions. He doesn't write on the board or use powerpoints so active listening is required. Wonderful, interesting classes.", 
            "This was undoubtedly the worst class I've ever taken. Since I'm not paying to learn his political opinions, but rather actual things that actually happened in history, this class was a huge disappointment. If you're a fan of capitalism or just America in general, chances are this class will infuriate you. Don't take the class, save yourself.", 
            "Worst class I have taken at this University. i was extremely excited to learn about this topic, but could not get through the cumbersome readings. Professor Suny rarely teaches the class and has guest lecturers almost every week. Therefore, the class is all over the place and extremely confusing. There is not enough structure in this class.", 
            "Best professor I've ever had. It's extremely rare to have a professor that's so brilliant and distinguished yet takes such a personal interest in his students. Very interesting, very friendly, and very helpful. He really cares about his students. Go chat it up with him in office hours!!", 
            "Very good professor. Great at explaining everything Russian. He does reveal his political leanings, but it does not influence his teaching. This is a great class for people at all levels of knowledge and he is a great lecturer. Beware of guest lecturers though - they are a mixed lot.", 
            "One of the most knowledgeable and interesting professors I have ever had. He made his political leanings clear and was very fair to all sides (within the boundaries of fact - not for the sake of PC). Plus, he's just a great guy. Highly recommend.", 
            "This professor is overbearing and disrespectful of students. He assumes you couldn't possibly say anything new or valuable, that he or someone else hasn't thought of long ago. I wonder why he teaches undergrads.", 
            "I found this professor to be small and petty. If you agree with his political beliefs exactly, and fawn all over him, you will get a good grade.", 
            "Very intelligent, enthusiastic professor. Easy to understand and helpful. I learned a lot from him. Also, good to have conversations with outside of class. The class's biggest flaw is not with him; rather, it's with the organization. Half the time, we got guest lecturers, and a lot of the time, they would not be as interesting or clear.", 
            "He's the man!", 
            "Suny is very good at lecturing and the readings are easy to understand. He really wants his students to do well and thats why he gives take home exams. However, this class consisted of many guest lecturers, most of which were not good. Overall, not a bad class, but it wouldve been better without the guest lecturers", 
            "Lectures weren't the greatest to be rather honest. It's more than obvious that this is his area of expertise and many elements of his discussions are fascinating. The problem is, is that you have to pick out those great parts from the rest. Outside of the classroom, he's incredibly helpful and very fascinating for conversation.", 
            "Best professor I've had at U of M. He's very passionate about the subject he's teaching, as he's currently writing a book on the subject. Very helpful and insightful.", 
            "Nations and Nationalism. Readings were hit and miss, discussion GSI good. Lecture was useless as Suny would dumb everything down yet require advanced understanding for the papers. Good class if you can just do all the learning on your own, but I will never take a Suny class again."

He started this class with a tirade about why we should care about his minicourse, but he never stopped. His syllabus is confusing and lacks info. His lectures are unorganized.", 
            "Larry lacks enthusiasm or interest in the class and students. He gives little to no information about the exam and consistently tells the class to use their \"collective intelligence\" to answer any questions. His Powerpoints are unorganized and have no information. He speaks in a monotone voice all lecture. Must cram and learn on your own for final.", 
            "Not an easy A; not an easy class. Lectures are hard to understand and slides have little to no information on them.", 
            "Larry is easily the worst professor I have ever had!! I have never rated a prof on here but felt it was my duty to review him just so other students do not have to endure the hell that is his class. He tells you not to study because exams will be easy but makes exams extremely difficult and then does not curve. Worst course/professor", 
            "Larry Ruff is very knowledgable about the earth and really cares about the environment. He is passionate and wants to help future generations save the earth from itself. There is no homework besides a powerpoint presentation every four weeks (very easy). The only tests are the midterm and the final. If you put in the slightest effort you will pass.", 
            "In my term, over 50% of the students received As. (He emailed us the grading statistics). As long as you do his many projects and memorize the lecture slides, you will get an A or an A+. Larry Ruff is a good, considerate guy (No Homo). Class discussions are as unbiased as you can get from any University. Spend your class time on studying the slides", 
            "He is not clear on his expectations for the group presentations, which are very low once I learned his expectations at the end of the term. Your grade is determined by the two exams. He has low poster and final paper expectations; you get an A by completion. Memorize the lecture slides in class to be more time efficient. Exams are student lectures", 
            "This is hands down the worst professor I've had at UM. There is no organization to the class at all. Powerpoints are not helpful and neither is attending lecture. Ruff refuses to answer any questions at all regarding anything. His answer is always to \"figure it out yourself\" or \"ask other students.\" Avoid this class like the plague.", 
            "This guy literally doesn't know his head from his ass. I would rather take a class taught by a group of insects who grew up in the USA about Israeli culture. I mean this guy is about as valuable as a broken urinal.", 
            "Worthy", 
            "this guy is the worst. i don't know how he ties his own shoes in the morning.", 
            "worst teacher ever, confusing too and bad lectures. hes so rude and arrogant and wont help when u ask a question. he says \"go figure it out yourself\"- word for word. his tests are not bad but there is SOO much stress because u have to learn everything urself because his lectures suck and u panic. most kids get a B, not an easy A.", 
            "Larry is an absolute legend. His classes are truly entertaiing. I couldn't care less about this class beyond the entertainment of his lectures", 
            "Prof. Ruff is extremely knowledgeable and very approachable.", 
            "I did not enjoy this class. I have been fascinated with natural disasters my whole life and thought about making it a career, but this class completely turned me off of it. His teaching is terrible and very confusing.", 
            "I usually dont have a problem with professors being condescending and rude, so long as they are helpful; Professor Ruff, however, was rude and completely resistant any form of constructive class discussion.", 
            "if Prof. Ruff doesnot respect the course he teaches, but treats this minicourse as a joke himself, then this class is a joke.", 
            "I took this class pass/fail and would definitely recommend it to people who need an easy NS credit. The few times I went to lecture it was pretty boring but the prof seems like a really nice guy.", 
            "He's awesome! This is what a mini course is supposed to be like-- just come to class and you'll get an A. I don't see why all these people are complaining. He's hilarious too and he seems as if he really wants his students to enjoy the subject of geology."

            "Mariela is the BEST spanish professor I've ever had. She enjoys speaking with students. She is creative and engaging with how she teaches the language, which makes learning spanish feel more realistic and less textbook and worksheet oriented. She gives homework every night but honestly it is the best way to study. My whole class loved her 3", 
            "Mariela is a phenomenal teacher. Past Spanish instructors haven't been nearly engaged&hands; on as Mariela--she gives every student the opportunity to succeed and she WANTS you to succeed which makes a huge difference. I hated Spanish&I; am leaving her class with a new found love of the course and language. If you want somebody who cares, she's it!3", 
            "Mariela was a wonderful teacher. You watch music videos every class (a good way to kill 5 minutes) and have a new partner every day. Class was engaging and interesting, and Mariela is hilarious. She has no control over the material on the exams, which can be a bit tough, but provides study guides for them. Excellent Spanish 231 experience. 10/10.", 
            "She is very funny and plays Spanish music videos every class which is fun but the class was extremely disorganized.", 
            "Mariela was awesome! She was very clear what was going to be on the tests and wanted the best for her students. She never had quizzes and graded easy for the Thematic Reactions, workbook and essay portions of the test. She did expect you to come to class everyday with the short homework assignment completed but that wasn't bad.", 
            "Mariela is great. Her classes are laid-back but you are still guaranteed to learn something. She provides a wonderful environment for her students that is student-driven. I'd recommend any of my friends taking Spanish classes to try to take hers. There are fun activities that are social and engaging while also helping to reinforce the material", 
            "I came into this Spanish class with only a mediocre high school background. At first, I had a rough time. Mariela helped me improve dramatically and I am thankful for all her support and effort. She is funny and enjoys her students company. She makes a tough class one in which you can still smile. Take this class for 231. She is an amazing lady.", 
            "First Spanish class at Michigan. Was a blast! Enjoyed going to every lecture as the classes were engaging and fun. I feel like my Spanish has improved exponentially as well. There is homework everyday but that is typical for any Spanish class. Buena suerte!", 
            "I loved her class. She was very helpful and made the class fun. She also interacted really well with the students and my entire class was sad that she wasn't teaching 232. I would've loved to take another class from her.", 
            "She's a blast! Mariela makes Spanish 231 an exciting class that is worth coming to, and she even shows a spanish music video everyday in class!", 
            "Mariela is an amazing instructor. I had her for Spanish 230 and 232 and both classes improved my spanish immensely. . Her class on Spanish Music and Culture is very interesting and I loved the way she taught it!! Great teacher!!!!", 
            "I had Mariela as a tutor for 230 and after seeing her for a few weeks my grade improved a whole letter grade! She knows so many helpful tips and is super encouraging. Worth the money as a tutor, and I'm sure she would be a great professor! I only wish I had gone to her sooner!!", 
            "She is great! The class is definitely tough, but her class is interesting and she knows a ton about it.", 
            "Mariela is amazing! I learned more in one semester with her than in 4 semesters in high school. Speaks slow enough that you can understand her but also so that you can learn. She is super funny and also really willing to help you outside of class! Taking a class with her next semester cause she's so awesome!!!", 
            "She makes this class extremely difficult, so if you are not good at spanish I would not recommend. However, she is my favorite professor at U of M after a semester because she makes the class interesting and fun with activities. The homework load is a little tough, but manageable. I can say that I really learned a lot about spanish musical culture",

He was once the chair of Putnam problem committee, so he is very familiar with difficult problems, including the International Mathematics Olympiad. You will get much more than the course material if you are interested and often talk about the problems with him.", 
            "Really smart professor, but he has no idea how to teach. His grading rubric was unclear, his answers to simple questions left the class more confused, and the pop quizzes in lecture were impossible. The only way to learn was reading the textbook.", 
            "He is terrible. I don't care what he's teaching it'll be bad. He's unorganized, never tells you what section from the book he's teaching from, and when he's teaching he stares at the board doing examples. Even when he's doing examples he writes really fast and is talking the entire time and doesn't write what he's talking about. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!",

Textbook is already poorly organized w/o highlight def and thm. His lectures are even worse. Beside, you need to memorize all formulas and def for quits and exams.",

He is not engaging and refuses to answers questions in lecture, mumbling to the blackboard for an hour and often confusing himself as much as his students",

He tests on concepts and the handouts he gives, can seldom have basic probability calculations in the test.",

He lectures at the board all lecture and continues and continues to talk although everyone is lost and still stuck on the first thing he wrote down. You can't follow the lectures, and you will have to teach yourself everything.",

As an expert in Number Theory he sometimes can have the assumption that we, his undergraduate students, are as smart as he is--which is clearly not true. However he does realize this after the first midterm and started being quite reasonable--did apply a good curve",

Never once has he asked if anyone have questions, let alone turned from the chalkboard. If you like prof's who give you prac exams that in no way exemplify the difficulty/problemset of the exam, then he's the prof4u",

            "Professor Montgomery teaches high level math(he's very knowledgeable), and having him for calc 2 was not a good fit. He spent lecture speaking to the black board and not the class. I learned most of the material on my own. Professor Montgomery is very friendly and approachable, just not someone I would choose for a calc 2 professor.", 
            "Montgomery is without a doubt a brilliant man. His lectures, however, leave much to be desired. As he's been working with Number Theory for probably 30-40 some years, he is very well-versed and often assumes students are, too. His lectures were confusing at best and tests were very difficult. Office hours were better but not by much.",

            "In my opinion, he is not a good lecturer and really does not know the subject matter very well. Much more alarmingly though is the fact that he said multiple racist and sexist comments to both myself and to my friends who took the class with me. Also, he made fun of my other friend (who has a disability) who took a different class with him.",

There's often 3-4 assignments \"in play\" at all times, so it's important to keep up.",

Project-based courses like 373+470 are a ton of work and require a lot of time; Dr Brehob amply prepares all of his students with fast-paced and information-rich lectures and strives for universal comprehension.

I took his 100 class without reading prereqs (yes 100 classes have those) and I went in with no programming experience(which I wouldn't recommend). I had a mildly talented group and our final project failed completely, but I went to his exam review sessions, beasted the exams, and got a B+. Also LEARNED A TON",

This is one of the harder ENGR100's, but if you're going into CE, EE, or have an interest, than take this class (either with Brehob or Peter Chen)",

He takes an interest in all of his students and their progress through his class. Only bad thing is the fact that he attended MSU for undergrad. The Class isn't easy, but it's THE U of M...",

He really knows the material very well and his lectures are pacy. But, he does summarize important points in the end. Grade-wise not easy."

In fact, whenever I came across any issues, he was always there to help me figure them out. While it's difficult to make a subject like technical communication as exciting as you thought it would be, you'll have no problem getting a good grade.", 
            "Seems to not care about what he teaches, boring, and overall a bad professor. Avoid.", 
            "He was very confusing. I had a tough time trying to understand what he wanted from us. When you ask questions, never gave a clear response. He always wanted to help us, though. Likes handouts.", 
            "Seems to be a good guy. However he is absurdly boring and annoying, cannot engage the class AT ALL. He is very unclear in instructions although he is a tech comm instructor. Pretty contradictory if you ask me. He usually answers questions with more questions or shoulder shrug and a brief \"hmm\". 3 for easiness bc easy class, not for teaching ability", 
            "He mostly read off of the slides, while he was clear during lecture he wouldn't do much more than read the slides he posted online anyways. I never went to his office hours and mostly relied on my friends, so I don't know how helpful he is there. I heard from my friends he was helpful in office hours, but lectures weren't particularly inspiring.", 
            "While Kominsky means well, he is not a good professor. The subjects he chooses to focus on are boring and the writing assignments he gives are uninspiring. I spent many days bored out of my mind working on assignments he gave and slamming my head against my keyboard because of time wasted on his class.", 
            "He doesn't give clear feedback on technical papers. It's never clear exactly what he's looking for. Presentations were terrible.", 
            "Kominsky means well, but his lectures are really unclear, and you'll learn more from the (free !) textbook. Go to labs and talk to GSIs and you'll be fine.", 
            "Kominsky's lectures were long and boring. There was no need to go to class because the lectures were posted online!! There was only one test and one midterm. Although I never attended Kominsky's office hours, I attended the graduate student instructors' (GSI) office hours. The GSIs were very helpful and made it easy to get a good grade in the class", 
            "Didn't learn much from his 101 lectures. Tended to go over concepts without explaining the programming methodology behind them. Going to lecture is a waste of time, the real learning in this class comes from doing the labs and projects on your own. The difficulty disparity between lecturelab and the projects was also unreal.", 
            "He doesn't seem to be the brightest person. He makes a lot of mistakes with his lecture examples. All his lectures are online so attendance isn't necessary. I suggest a different professor for this class.", 
            "Kominsky is a good guy who is too smart for his own good. He is much more suited to teaching upper level classes. Because of this, he isn't able to explain things very well, and he is definitely dry. Nothing particularly interesting about his lectures, which if you put some of your own work in, you don't need to go to.", 
            "Not bad... but his lectures were dry. His slides were great to learn from though although I heard Ringenberg for this course. I don't think the lecturer matters too much since the course is unified for all professors. Projects and labs aren't that bad if you have friends to work with. That being said, the exams are something to study for.", 
            "ENGR 101 was synchronized this semester(F14) so all three profs were teaching the same material. Everyone did the same homeworklabsprojects. Kominsky is nice and helpful in office hours, but his lectures are really boring and he can be extremely unclear sometimes when he's explaining things. The textbooks are only useful for the online homework.", 
            "So Kominsky gets a lot of slack for being a bad teacher but honestly I find him to be delightful and he does teach pretty well. I took it W13 and yes although he did have a few awkward pauses, I believe he was trying to make it a more interactive lecture than just him talking at us because he believes coding is better learnt by doing at leastin 101", 
            "Not horrible. Projects are harder, but there are less of them. If you start early and GO TO OFFICE HOURS theyre not too bad. Exams arent that bad either, theyre open note. I found I learned more by skipping class and reading lecture slides on my own. Class was kind of all over the place.", 
            "Lectures were dry, but slides were great for review and Paul would diligently answer all questions without demeaning you. Projects were hard but doable. Grades were fair and regrades were very generous. His projects are harder than other profs', but you get two fewer projects than other sections. Exams are easy if you study slides and project code.", 
            "Kominsky's class was not a hard class, Exams are worth less than projects which helps grades. Exams are open note, so as long as you understand the material you don't need to memorize functions and syntax. Make sure to double check the grading on exams, GSI's often take off too much. Some projects were vague. However, office hours help a lot.", 
            "I agree with most of what was said. Yes, this was probably the hardest 101 section. I would avoid taking this class, but if you HAVE to take it IT IS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. Lectures are kinda pointless, projects are vague, but go into GSI office hours and you'll be okay and exams will be a lot easier if you actually understand the projects.", 
            "Has to be the WORST professor at this university. Lectures are not helpful at all and very boring which makes it hard to learn. Projects are very vague and hard to understand. Willingness to help is very low. For an INTRO class, there is nothing intro about it. Teaches as if the students came in with prior coding knowledge"

The material she teaches in lecture gives you the base for what you need to know, then through a lot of PREP practice and self-study you start to learn what she'll ask on exams. She does want everyone to succeed, and she gives a lot of her time for that. Use Piazza and office hours as much as you can!", 
            "Gottfried is approachable and makes sure you understand the material. There's lots of office hours and if you post on Piazza she responds very quickly. However, her lectures/homework are NOT representative of exams AT ALL. Be prepared to rage while doing the PREP and rage again at the exams because they are wayyyyy harder than any lecture material.", 
            "Dr. Gottfried is an incredible professor. Although this is debatably the hardest pre-med class at the University of Michigan, she explains everything in a way that makes sense. She seems to genuinely want her students to succeed. That being said, her exams are extremely difficult, but she does curve them. Would not take Pchem with any other prof.", 
            "She's a stellar professor, and although it's true that the exams will likely push you beyond your limits, you can do well in the class. You get one exam's worth of points for midterm improvement, homework, and discussion as a buffer. Also, PREP is divided into sections by topic, so start the problems as soon as something is discussed in lecture.", 
            "While Gottfried appears to be nice superficially, her exams are simply too difficult, and the class is even worse than orgo in that she teaches you extremely easy barebones stuff, and you literally teach yourself essentially everything else. There is really no point in paying for this course when I have legitimately taught myself all the material.", 
            "Gottfried is the only thing that made PChem bearable. She's one of the most committed professors on campus and wants to help her students. Her exams are extremely difficult, but she holds so many office hours to help us understand the material. This would probably be my least favorite course if any other professor taught it.", 
            "One of my favorite professors at Michigan. She teaches clearly and makes lecture engaging. She provides tons of opportunities to ask questions in person and online, and always makes a point to be thorough, as well as make sure all students have the opportunity to ask their questions. Dr. G's class took heavy commitment but was extremely rewarding.", 
            "Dr. Gottfried teaches you how to mature in your thinking. Every PChem topic has some key concepts, all of which are relatively easy to learn by doing practice problems, but the exams require you to solve problems of unprecedented difficulty to apply those concepts. She wants you to do well, and you can. Take a deep breath & ask for help if need be", 
            "Great professor, really cares about chemistry and her students. She makes it clear what you have to do to succeed. She writes some tough exam questions, but gives you plenty of practice to prepare. Surprised she doesn't have a higher ranking.", 
            "As others have noted, this is a very difficult class, and for me is the hardest I've taken in undergrad. That said, the exams are still fair. Still, she's an excellent lecturer, is super friendly and will go out her way to help students. Start the PREP ideally 7-14 days in advance, complete it twice and try to time yourself. Learn to problem solve", 
            "Dr. Gottfried is probably one of the best and worst professors I've had. When you first meet her you love her and after the first exam you hate her. She teaches the material well and provides ample practice for her exams, however what is in her PREP does not guarantee it will be on her exam. To do well: Go to class, finish PREP, and reread notes.", 
            "please i just want to pass p chem :/ her exams are hard but she gives you all the resources. i get stressed during the exams and cried during two of them because they were so hard but she's nice",

            "Chem 230 is a tough class but Dr. Gottfried makes it enjoyable and provides lots of resources to aid you throughout the semester. Piazza was very interactive and she would provide immediate feedback (within 24 hours). She also scheduled lots of office hours. As long as you start the PREP 7 days+ prior to the exam, it's very doable.", 
            "not a good advisor and not a good professor.", 
            "Gottfried is the only 230 professor. She taught well but the class was way too hard, and it is her choice to make it that way. The class material was a lot easier than test material. I struggled hard in this class and went to her office hours and it didn't seem to faze her. Studied 24/7. Relied heavily on my GSI. My advice is to take 260 instead.", 
            "Dr. Gottfried gives clear and concise lectures. It is clear that she cares about her students and their level of success in and out of her class. She is accessible through piazza. If you don't skip class and take your time to study for at least a week before the exams, the class is very manageable.", 
            "Chem 230 is definitely a challenging course, but you will be so grateful that you took it with Professor Gottfried. She forces you to become an excellent critical thinker in addition to chemistry student.", 
            "The hardest class that I have taken at the university. With that being said, it is also the most rewarding premed class that I have taken thus far. She has many office hours, so go to them whenever you can. Always is willing to meet with you outside of class if things are unclear. DO THE PREP PACKET TWICE IF NEED BE!"

In my opinion he cares very much about his students and is very understanding.",

            "Prof. Rotella is really not all that bad, but she'll make you work for that grade. I learnt a lot from the class, but preparing for it took too much of my time this semester which I will never do over. Take another class except you have a special interest in this subject. You work too hard for too little. Test heavy, lecture heavy, too many HW's!", 
            "No practice exams!!! I really need to use a sad face smiley rn.", 
            "She gives a 10 question multiple choice on exams and that't be 30% of your exam grade. You get one wrong, that's 3% off your exam grade. I don't know anything that makes less sense (other than Trump being President) and this is getting more common among Econ professors. Exam is writing heavy and time is too short. Cheat sheet is allowed though.", 
            "The class is mostly about memorising data and readings which are what half of the exams materials. Materials are not much applied on the international scope. Seems to know a lot about her field though. Overall, not highly recommended as you won't really learn anything useful except for some economics data", 
            "(Econ 466 review) This is a pretty interesting class with a lot of cool topics, ruined by the worst professor Michigan has to offer. Treating her class like 5 year olds, this class is defined by seating charts, constant surveillance of your laptops and pop quizzes. Her non curved grading of exams (avg 70) is excessively detailed. Terrible", 
            "Rotella is an interesting professor and very passionate about economics. If you are interested in the class you should do fine. She cares about her students, but can be kind of tough.",

            "Exams are actually not that tough. You can get a high score if you do good in multiple choices because these are pretty objective questions and you must know the exact answer to get credits. But you can get fairly high score for short and long essay as long as you show some understanding because these are pretty subjective. A brilliant professor!", 
            "Well versed in her class and really interesting material. But a combination of very specific pop quizzes along with overwhelming amounts of work on her tests makes me despise this class. Great lecturer terrible teacher.", 
            "This is a combination of upper level writing and Econ course. She is extremely picky on our usage of words. (e.g. the number of/the amount of; affect/effect) But I have to say she is a real scholar and well-versed in her area. She always gave us clear and detailed feedback. It could be enjoyable unless I ONLY had this course this semester.",

            "Amazing professor! Life lessons learned. Took him every semester I could!", 
            "Ralph claims to welcome all to the table for discourse, but ultimately he doesn't care about what you think unless you're agreeing with him. He welcomes varying interpretations, but if they disagree with his, he disregards them. He seems like a nice guy, but don't take this class unless you're willing to change your viewpoints to agree with him.", 
            "Completely disorganized.", 
            "I haven't met a more engaging man, I sat in on three of his lectures with a friend and I couldn't agree more with people. He is really smart, kind-harted, and a gentleman. He engages everyone with the respect you deserve and is willing to talk to any one, if I could I would take all of his classes", 
            "Everything just seemed a bit vague. No due dates for the readings and no tests until the final. Two papers on whatever you please (as long as it's relevance can be argued). Lectures are rambling and theatrical. Perhaps the topic just wasn't of interest to me, or maybe I need more structure than what was given, but this class wasn't my favorite.", 
            "I've taken 3 classes wProf. Williams. At first I was a huge fan of his. But I started to realize he uses the same anecdotes and same wandering manner in lectures. Very scattered, doesn't explain concepts in clear manner and asks \"Yay or nay\" in a way that discourages dissent. I feel like he's trying to impart life lessons, not analyze the texts", 
            "Williams is much more preoccupied with impressing his students through his performances in class rather than teaching you anything, even though he claims the opposite. He's very set in his ways; even though books should be up to the interpretation of the reader, it's his way or you're wronggraded down. I felt like my time and money was wasted.", 
            "I took Williams because I had heard great things, and I've never been more disappointed. Rather than teach, he really just gives book reports, yet he expects his students to analyze for their essays. However, on the final, he expects you to repeat what he said in class, which I don't view as helpful to me in any way. So, you have to go to class.", 
            "Ralph is a very knowledgable professor and has historical context deeply ingrained into his lectures. Unfortunately, he tends to ramble on in his lectures, leaving an abundance of muddled information. Regardless, his lectures are very eye-opening and interesting.", 
            "Talk about a guy who shapes your college career--who shapes you for life. Ralph is it. One of the most genuine, enthusiastic, kind-hearted and dedicated professors at UM. I brought a friend from another top-ranked school to sit in on one of his lectures--my friend was floored. He picks great books and speaks about them with unparalleled passion.", 
            "It would be a sin go to U of M and not take his class. His lack of schedule and frustrations with that will be made up by wit, charm, and inspiration. He is the smartest guy I ever met- and extremely humble. I still have pages of my notebook from tid-bits I found inspiring in his class. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. Sorry for being extreme lol", 
            "Professor Williams is great! I took \"Memoirs and Social Crisis\" with him and his insights have truly changed the way I think about the world. Great guy, there for students, and really passionate about what he teaches. Grading expectations were somewhat high, but he's the kind of professor you want to do good for. Lots of EC available too!", 
            "This was my second class with Prof Williams and all I can say is I wish I could take a 3rd. He is an incredibly engaging speaker and steers discussion in incredibly interesting ways. I didn't only learn a lot about course material, but also about how to think. Even if you are not an english major, take a class with Ralph! You won't regret it!", 
            "I agree with everyone that he is a brilliant guy, knows his stuff, enthusiastic, and kind. HOWEVER, respectfully, he does have his blind spots. He'll treat material he disagrees with in a belittling manner and if you raise objections in class he just shuts you down. He's willing to engage in discussion, unless you end up disagreeing with him.", 
            "He's literally the best prof you'll ever have. He greets every single student in lecture every single day; he loves us that much and continually tells us how great it is to share time with us. I LOVE this class. We read memoirs about social crisis (slavery, holocaust, vietnam war, AIDS) and I honestly read all of them 'cause they were all great.", 
            "Ralph Williams is one of my favorite teacher on campus. Both the breadth and depth of his knowledge is astounding. He's clear and enthusiastic and compassionate; I highly recommend taking any class with him. I read all of Paradise Lost for this guy. He is gold.", 
            "Phenomenal!! Ralph Williams is so smart, so compassionate, and cares so much about his students. I've never met someone quite like him. I loved this class, and I was so sad when it was over. I had him as my discussion leader as well as for lecture, and that made the class even better. Our final exam was a discussion about Shakespeare at his house!", 
            "Professor Williams is astounding. His insight and comments on Shakespeare's writing is truly inspirational and eye-opening. His insists upon making a personal connection with each and every student (he shakes everyone in the hall hands)! If you have the opportunity to have this legend, do!", 
            "Ralph is a legend. I've never actually felt someone's passion for the material prior to taking this class. Even for works that I wasn't as interested in, he made it easy to appreciate them. I am truly honored that I had the opportunity to take his class this semester. If you haven't taken one of his classes, sign up now!!!"

When you leave Bacon's class, you don't come out just a better student, but a better human being. For the first time, I actually WANTED to go to lecture and was very upset when the class was over!", 
            "Greatest professor I have ever encountered. He wants his students to be great people and I left the class feeling like a better human being. Touching Bo Schembechler stories. Guest lecturers are amazing. So much to be learned about history through sports. Take his class before you graduate.", 
            "This is the best class at Michigan. Bacon is hilarious and makes lecture enjoyable. He teaches you so much info yet makes it entertaining with his first hand experiences and stories. If you get in take this class! If you go to every lecture you dont have to read either.",

Great guest lectures, including John Beilein, who wasn't even the best one.

His mantra is \"If you work hard for me, I will work hard for you.\" Never before have I had a teacher who is so engaged in the class and generally cares about every student. There is a lot of material, but it comes naturally as you usually understand everything he says. Not a stressful class by any means.", 
            "Bacon is a great lecturer. He makes every class very engaging and he knows each student by name which is huge. Sometime it's hard to tell if he's BSing stuff. He likes sticking to his shtick, which is entertaining, but gets repetitive. Overall, a cool class.",

            "Easily one of the best professors I've had at UM, period. His lectures are the highlight of my day. He is a no-nonsense professor, however, and you need to be prepared to work A LOT in this class. But when you work hard for him, he works hard for you, and you learn a lot. Don't plan on getting in unless you're a senior or a very lucky junior.",

He's also a super nice person and is always willing to help and clarify. Can't emphasize enough that this class is great on all levels.",

His passion rubs off instantly. If you have any chance to even go to one lecture of his you need to be there.", 
            "Last day of class in a 200 person lecture and he walks through the auditorium and greets every student BY NAME. Seriously. His exuberance for Michigan sports is entirely contagious. If you are the LEAST bit interested in the history of the University, I'd tell you to take this class. Sign up early, it filled up in less than a day.",

            "Love Professor Kiste, he was great. If you have to take Orgo 2, take it with Kiste. He explains things well and makes relevant connections between topics.", 
            "Had Kiste for both 210 & 215. He's awesome.", 
            "I too had Kiste for orgo 1 and 2 and he is well worth the early hours. He is really great at explaining concepts and he goes at the perfect pace. There are no issues with his writing and he is extremely helpful. And I agree with the previous person. LOVE the way he dresses. British flag vest anyone?", 
            "I had Kiste for orgo 1 and 2. I did that intentionally and it paid off. People complaining about his notes...Its college learn to listen and write for yourselves. Always willing to help. Also a VERY snazzy dresser. People willingly go to UM; quit complaining and take on the challenge u asked for when u committed to going here.", 
            "Kiste is the one to take for Orgo II. He goes much slower than the other profs and provides very organized lectures.", 
            "I'm definitely not a fan of Kiste. He knows his chemistry, but he is the hardest person to follow during lecture. Taking notes in his class is not an easy task because he is all over the board. Sometimes it seems like he tries to make everything unnecessarily complex too..."

            "I have no idea what these other people are talking about, he is awful. I did fine in Econ 101, but this class was so poorly run it is hard to see how anyone did well. DO NOT get this professor, he puts absolutely no effort into the poorly guided class.", 
            "Okay. Econ 101, 102 are very hard at U of M. But Bice gives you plenty of resources from which to study so that if you put in the time you will do well. Better than Deardoff/Johnson for 102 b/c tests are mult. choice and reasonable.", 
            "Easily my worst prof this term. So boring, not helful for his tests at all. Worst lectures ever, even when I come with a pot of coffee. 90% of people sleep, terrible teacher, no practical applications of econ, just formulas and theories.", 
            "He is very enthusiastic and says \"that's kinda cool\" A LOT!! The problem is goes over the material way to fast. It is as if he thinks he needs to get through a chapter an hour. The exams suck also. The GSI's are no help, maybe 1/100 speak e", 
            "Bice seems like a good guy. The class isn't interesting - but its econ. He has very detailed lectures which are posted, and helpful. Definetely not an easy class though, I personally didn't enjoy it, but I'm not getting into business either.", 
            "If you're able to stay awake in his class than you may do alright, oh and it'd probably help to have a GSI that actually speaks english. But good luck on that one and on staying awake in Bice's class (as if econ wasn't boring enough).", 
            "He is very excited about what he teaches. I feel bad for him because so many students walk out of lecture early, but I can sympathize with them as well. Bice is extremely nice, boring, but he will teach you if you can stay awake and listen.", 
            "He is a nice guy and is O.K. as a teacher. But there is just one problem. He had this amazing way of putting me to sleep every class (no matter how much sleep I had the night before). Simply put he is the most boring man I've ever met.",

He made me love coming to German every day and made me want to study abroad there when I'm older. If you are thinking about taking 101, do everything you can to get into Hartmut's class!", 
            "Words fail to describe how good of a professor Hartmut is. He truly cares about every single one of his students and goes above and beyond what's expected from a professor. He grades quickly and will have assignments/quizzes/essays back to you by the next class. Definitely would recommend him. He made my first year of German here fantastic.", 
            "Hartmut was, by far, the most incredible teacher I've ever had. I had taken some German in high school, but taking his class made me decide to minor in German and study abroad for a semester. He's fantastic and really cares about his students. Highly, highly recommend him as a professor. Plus, he's hilarious.", 
            "Hartmut is the bomb. He legitimately cares about his students, and you can tell that teaching is one of his main passions. I really appreciate how much time and effort he puts into making the class both funny but also informative. I've learned an insane amount of German in the few months that I've been in his class because he teaches so well.", 
            "Honestly the best teacher I have ever had. Really cares about his students and makes sure you can succeed. Also gets you to understand the material. He really triggered my love for the German language", 
            "Hartmut is absolutely amazing. He cares about every student and will notice you whether you're excelling or struggling. If you have the slightest interest in German or foreign languages in general, take this class (with Hartmut, if possible.)", 
            "This man is the reason I am in Germany right now and enchanted with this new language and set of skills. Truly brilliant and excellent professor. Great abilities in adapting his German to different students' levels.",

            "It's a hard class, especially if you don't have a lot of prior knowledge; very reading heavy. But he understands the challenge and is very willing to help and the grading is fair. He has the corniest sense of humor of any professor I have ever had.", 
            "Really fun and really helpful. Easily my favorite class/department.", 
            "With out a doubt the best teacher I've ever had. He is very funny and easy to relate to. If you need an extension on anything, Hartmut will accommodate. When you submit assignments or take tests, he corrects and explains what you did wrong and what you need to do to improve. He is very flexible and will jump through burning hoops for his students!",

            "Hartmut is simply amazing. He is the most creative professor I've ever had, and always makes class fun. Even if he doesn't teach your individual section, he still coordinates the course, so it is always fun. He is the reason why German is the only foreign language at U of M I have never heard people complaining about taking.",

            "Hartmut is GREAT! He goes above and beyond in his teaching, and is genuinely passionate about what he does. He makes sure that everyone in the class understands the concepts, and is willing to spend hours out of class if a student doesn't understand something. LOVE Hartmut!", 
            "Goes out of his way to help students and even brings baked goods to class sometimes. He would explain something 200 times in 200 different creative ways if you needed him to. A lot of work but I never thought it was busy work or pointless.",

            "Great prof, great class. Learned more on interdisciplinary engineering topics in this class than I did in any of my engineering classes. Assignments and quizzes were fine. Even took some field trips!"

Unlike previous commenters, I LOVED the way he taught film as an art form, because it IS an art form. It makes you notice things in your daily life watching films, and enhances them. It increases your cultural understanding.", 
            "It's clear he knows his material well and is passionate about it. On the other hand, he is pretty old, lectures become very dry, and clips used are very outdated and not engaging compared to what they could be. How to do well: read the example final exam at the beginning and base your work/studying off that. GSI is super important...", 
            "With all the positive ratings of this class, I worry Cohen has lost his fire. The class itself was good - due to screenings and my great GSI. However, Cohen's lectures are disorganized, dry and repetitive. I felt like my time was wasted going to lecture. I've heard others had a great experience in this class with Solomon. Wish I had had him.", 
            "Hugh's certainly passionate about the material, and he's very approachable and friendly if you get to know him. We also watch quite a few good movies. Lectures can be long and a bit boring, and the writing assignments can be a bit nitpicky, but it helps to make you a better writer and a more intuitive thinker.", 
            "Dr. Cohen wasn't my favorite professor. I don't like how he taught film as an art form, he was very objective and unrealistic in his analysis (not everything in the frame is for the art, there is such a thing as a budget).", 
            "Professor Cohen is really smart and knows his stuff. He plays a lot of movie clips, but even so, if found myself nodding off more than a time or two. If you are really into analyzing movies or are majoring in SAC, this class is a must, but otherwise, don't it. Professor Cohen is such a nice person and he will never ever make you feel inferior.", 
            "Value thinking for yourself?: do NOT take this class. All of his opinions were unquestionable to the point where subjectivity had been gutted from the class. I managed to get a good grade, requiring many outside conversations to gain clarification. His vague assignment descriptions and incomplete syllabus hurt students. No compassion for students..", 
            "The Professor was fine but be careful on picking your GSI. They determine your whole grade, because grading is not standardized across sections. AVOID YUKI NAKAYAMA.", 
            "Prof Cohen is adorable, and his lectures are nothing short of fun. He shows lots of awesome movie clips. When I got much busier towards the end of the semester,I was able to just skip his lectures entirely and still do fine. That said, be VERY careful who you get for your GSI, as they determine your entire grade.", 
            "Awesome! One of my favorite teachers. I'm majoring in the Screen Arts & Cultures because of him. I definitely recommend this class with him!", 
            "Cohen is amazing. I had him back in Spring 2008; he explained things well and the class was fairly graded if you took the effort. (My GSI was overzealous so I asked for regrades by him and ended up getting A-'s instead of B's.) He's one of the best professors I've had if you don't include Rust and Nolta.", 
            "Really passionate about the subject and good at demonstrating and providing examples for different concepts. Really nice guy, fun class, and he chooses good films for the writing assignments. GSIs may be tough on grading, but each assignment is a small part of the grade. Pay attention and you'll get a lot out of the class.", 
            "Cohen can be long winded and boring as a lot of people have noted, but he is without a doubt passionate about what he teaches and is an intelligent, incredibly nice man. Sometimes he's not entirely clear on his expectations, but his grading is never unreasonable, and you'll find it difficult to dislike him even when he rambles. Very good-natured.", 
            "I LOVE HIM!! BEST PROFESSOR EVER!! A tough grader but you learn so much. :)", 
            "Enjoyed the class and learned alot, Cohen can get a bit boring in lecture but you can really tell he loves the movies he is talking about. I felt grading was fair and the test and final paper were nothing that we were not perpared for. Also, I learned so much about all the movie classics, a great class even if Cohen gets a bit boring in lecture.", 
            "I found the lectures to be dull and stopped attending them fairly early on. The class itself was an excellent experience, more than just getting a grade. I was lucky enough to get Kristy Rawson as my GSI. She had a keen intellect and was extremely fair. I didn't study for the exam and feel that I could have gotten an A if I had. The class>Cohen", 
            "This class makes me appreciate film so much more. He really knows what he's talking about and uses film clips in every lecture. He tends to read straight from the coursepack for some lectures, but for the most part they are decent. I hated my GSI though -- rude, irresponsible, and a hardass. I recommend the course though!", 
            "Cohen is amazing! He is so donw-to-Earth - you can talk to him about any film of any genre. He assigned Hustle and Flow for our final paper. I loved every minute of lecture, but my GSI was a hardass and murdered my grade. Cohen is really a genius and very passionate, I recommend him highly.",

There were 2 weekly assignments, and a few others scattered throughout the semester. None of it was hard, but some of it could be time-consuming. Overall, easy and chill class!", 
            "I really liked how organized her lectures were and how clearly and concisely she explained the material. The system for online quizzes and pre-discussion homework was annoying; it was all in three different places and very easy to forget about one or the other. Four exams throughout the semester and they focus on applying concepts, not memorizing",

The exam material was sort of random, and it was very hard to get an A, even if you studied diligently. She was very approachable and nice, yet her lectures didn't always prepare you for the exams. Sometimes the reading was excessive.",

Be careful though, homework is very intensive; be ready to write multiple papers per week. I would definitely recommend taking this class with her! Come to lecture and discussion because you are graded for participation.",

Her tests are difficult, and made to stump your students. If you want an A, I highy recommend studying a week before hand and with a fellow student or two.",

Her tests were honestly easier than I thought they would be, which made me happy, but they still had some questions that will stump you. Her helpfulness could use some work, though. She almost seems annoyed.",

He is an amazing lecturer, full of jokes, and incorporates what is happening in politics in real time into the beginning of each class session. Pop quizzes were a part of my section grade.",

He has tons of knowledge and humor and is extremely invested and passionate about teaching, as he held debate watching party and three exam review sessions before exams. You definitely should go to his office hour before papers and revise your points with GSI. I regret not going to his office hour more often.",

He is approachable and always willing to do anything to help students learn and do their best. The only complaint I have about this class is the GSI's - mine just should not be a GSI for many reasons.", 
            "Mickey was a great Polisci professor. He really helped you out in office hours, and made it a point to know your name every time you asked a question. It really seemed like he cares a lot about his students. Would definitely take this again."

It becomes clear that Hutchings is an expert in the field when many of the readings in class quote his research. I felt privileged to have taken a class with him.",

Doing the readings makes the class 100% more interesting, as does participating actively and showing up to class. Only 3 assignments, but all were easy if you paid attention/read.",

Very clear teaching and makes class fly by, the material is a bit controversial at times but its super interesting to learn. GO TO CLASS because the exams are basically memorizing the notes that are not posted on canvas but sooo worth it. Definitely recommend him!", 
            "Professor Hutchings is the most helpful Professor I've ever had. He always offers great advice in his office hours and his lectures are very clear as well. Attendance isn't mandatory, but you need to go to class to prep for the two exams. Definitely take this class.", 
            "Hutchings really cares about his students. This class is all about the lecture and nothing more - you listen, take notes, memorize and study for the exam. That being said, Hutchings is a lively teacher, the topic was interesting, and he tries to engage.", 
            "Professor Hutchings is a the top of his field. The material is complicated so pay attention in class. Read the assigned reading before class. For exams, do not give opinions until you have offered the leading arguments from all perspectives. For papers, no fluff or fillers, identify arguments, pro and cons to each and structure it well.",

Very impressive accomplishments",

She has a such a bubbly personality, and is just a great person. Be prepared to wait several weeks for each and every grade, though. And 7 papers...", 
            "Burgard is an amazing professor. Extremely passionate about the content. There are some lengthy readings, but they can be really interesting. Exams are rather straightforward and she provides study materials in advance. This class gives insight into many concepts that are helpful in many careers.", 
            "GSIs are awesome, and my discussion was my favorite class. The amount of papers is insanely heavy along with readings. Prof Burgard loves what she teaches but lecture can be a little boring sometimes. Overall interesting (I expected it to be a little bit more though) and not too tough.",

Not the easiest social science but I would definitely recommend it.",

Professor Burgard is also extremely nice.",

Paying attention during lectures will really reduce study time as a lot of definitions are discussed but not on the slides. Sometimes a little dull but class was interesting and Prof Burgard is very nice! Definitely take if interested in Soc!",

            "Difficult exams that don't cover the material but you're ability to find the tricks she puts in multiple choice. Impossible grading rubrics on short answers and essays. She often uses the phrase \"something to think about\" if the class doesn't respond to a question. Overall, this is the worst class I have taken at the University.",

The tests were mostly short answer and long, but very manageable if you study. Only downside is that he's mainly a public policy professor so he doesn't hold office hours and Dr. Caldwell handles all contact with students.",

I read the textbook readings before every class and attended every lecture. Your grade is mostly composed of three tests, so study the practice ones they give you, and know the concepts well.",

Exams have 7-8 MC questions and about 15 free response; graded fairly, but very tough. Don't raise your hand in lecture, Justin will humiliate you in front of the whole 400 person lecture.", 
            "Explained economics extremely well. Don't understand why so many people rate him as a difficult professor, he taught the class so well when I took it that he couldn't curve it because the grades were too high. And this was not because he made the course easier it's because he taught us better. Lectures aren't mandatory but they are engaging.", 
            "He is an amazing professor and his lectures are really fun. The exams were much harder than I was expecting. He doesn't give many practice problems to help prepare for the types of questions on the exam. Also, I found it a bit odd that he doesn't write the exams himself.", 
            "Professor Wolfers is brilliant, and explains material extremely well. He makes the material super applicable to the real world, and is truly passionate about economics. His tests are primarily free response which makes them quite difficult, but he definitely prepares you well.", 
            "Decent lectures that can be engaging but also tend to run a bit long. Tests require time management, but by no means are excessively long if you keep your answers to the point. Hardly any practice exams and a bit disconnected with students because professor Caldwell answers emails and holds office hours. Reading isn't necessary but helpful.", 
            "Lectures are boring. Tests are heavy and long, and each test makes you to write for over 1000 words. Lectures slides and quiz are not related to the test questions. He never give back feedbacks on anything.",

            "Professor Wolfers has a vast knowledge of economics and teaches it very clearly. Personally, I found his lectures pretty engaging. The textbook, which he wrote, is a fairly easy read. My only complaint is that the exams were way too long; I barely finished each one in time.", 
            "Wolfers is a very smart and knowledge professor. However, even though the material content is not that hard, the exams can get pretty hard along with being time pressured and graded quite hardly. I would get a point or so dinged for a very simple mistake that my AP econ teacher would just ignore.", 
            "I got a 5 on AP Micro but don't believe that I can get more than a B on this class. Wolfer's lectures get boring really quickly and all of his exams are hard and EXTREMELY time pressured. The panic I have had while taking his exams has taken the fun out of Economics for me. The class is never going to be curved. Take Econ 101 with Dudley instead.", 
            "Extremely overrated teacher. Although Wolfers is quite intelligent, he lacks the ability to engage students. His lectures often drag on for too long, causing most of the students in the class to get distracted. In addition, his tests have been extremely difficult to finish on time and the class isn't even getting curved. Choose another professor.", 
            "If you want to really learn economics and its application in the real world, Wolfers is the best. His background and his involvement in economics in the real world makes his lectures much more relevant and interesting. He's also pretty engaging and funny.", 
            "Wolfers was one of my favorite professors at this university. His lectures are very engaging and he does an excellent job at applying economics to everyday life. The exams are mostly free response, but if you do the reading and go to class, it isn't that bad. Wolfers is the man for Econ 101."

Nancy Kerner was not helpful at all, and the GSIs are useless; they can't tell you anything, and they mark you down hugely for small mistakes & sometimes for no reason other than that the class average must be at a certain percent (if you ask what you did wrong, they don't respond).

Completely useless class",

The class focuses on teaching you 3-5 rules that are results of your experiments and to ace the exam one simple needs to memorize those rules. Lectures are long winded ways of explaining them, so no need to go",

While her lectures are very boring, they are also very clear. Labs are very, very difficult to perform/understand without them. If you go to lecture and use the practice exams, you should get a good grade."

            "Simmons is a good lecturer, he made 9ams 3 days a week bearable. Better than the second half lecturer at explaining concepts. Tests are still pretty difficult, even if you go to lecture and study hard. Average is about 10 points lower than Bio 171 so get ready.",

Quizzes weren't too difficult as long as you paid attention and read the articles, but were sometimes graded harshly and inconsistently. Besides that, Dr. Simmons was great.", 
            "Dr. Simmons is supportive and a great lecturer. He's funny and clear and is always willing to give help. The class is just hard and the exam averages are in the low 70s. The course requires you to know a lot of material so be ready to study a lot before the exams.", 
            "Professor Simmons explains hard topics in a way that is easy to understand, but you will have to study if you want to understand. He is always available to extra help if needed!", 
            "Dr. Simmons is a nice guy. I felt his exams were very well written. There were just one or two questions that were totally not addressed in the lecture slides - still a little salty about that - but overall he did a nice job. He kind of treats students like children by giving stretch breaks mid-lecture but whatever.",

You just need to memorize a lot of information, and that takes a long time, but it's not a tricky class. He is always willing to help/explain further too.", 
            "Professor Simmons is friendly, approachable, and a great teacher. He is always clear in what you should know for each exam, and materials come straight from the powerpoints he presents - people claim his exams were too hard but I disagree. There is a lot of material covered, but he is always willing to answer questions and explain himself further.",

            "I had Dr. Simmons for Bio 207 and he was just as laid-back, approachable, clear, etc. for 489. Quizzes are not difficult...you just have to read and understand the papers. However, the papers are some-what time-consuming to read, so make you put the time in. Material was interesting for the most part; I would recommend this class with him!"

Donald seemed to be a good lecturer, but I had (and still have) no interest in the greatbooks field, so I found his lectures to be boring and a waste of time (especially since it was at 9am). This class either teaches you to love humanities or skip lectures, and it was the latter for me.", 
            "This class will consume your life with the amount of reading and writing. Lectures aren't required but honestly, I would recommend going so that you have something relevant to say in discussion. Like others have said, grading is entirely dependent on GSI.", 
            "A nice guy. I went to all but one lecture but in all honesty you don't really need to go to any of them - some of the topics were definitely interesting if you're actually interested in the material like I was, but you won't really learn anything that's going to help you with your essays. Your GSI determines your grade, so hope for a good one.", 
            "I rarely went to lecture but when I did I enjoyed it and found the topics interesting. Sells pretty much just gives context to all of the books we \"read.\" The discussion class is where you have to put in the effort, and participate. I loved going to discussion, my GSI was great but when it comes to essays, be prepared for some B's.", 
            "Lots. Of. Writing. Sells makes the best out of the class, but remember that your grade is gonna depend completely on your GSI. It's a writing heavy course, probably the most writing intensive out of all the FYWRs.",

            "Well respected, pretty easy going guy. I struggled in his class as I was going through a lot of personal issues, but he's relatively understanding and gives help if its asked for. Lots of homework, each day essentially is a pop quiz over the reading from the previous night. Lots of work, but easy if you put forth the effort.",

            "Your grade is this class is 100% dependent on your GSI. This class had some pop quizzes, a large amount of reading, and multiple paper assignments. Additionally, lecture provides mostly cultural context for the readings, which some found boring and unhelpful as it did not directly relate to the readings.",

My GSI was never clear about how I could improve my writing even though I went for help several times. Writing wasn't too bad, except that grades for papers seemed way too arbitrary and subjective.",

As for the kids worried about reading: loll. all i did was ask my friends in earlier sections whether we had a test or not.. and then ask them to send me the questionsread sparknotes. I only read the first 2 pages of our first text in this class. ENTIRELY GSI dependent. Easy", 
            "Professor Sells lectures were interesting enough, but as a Classics professor teaching a first year writing course, they were kind of useless. My GSI graded all the papers (which are 80% of the grade). I could have never attended a single lecture and still have passed easily.", 
            "Sells does alright, I'd say he's an okay lecturer and the class content is usually interesting if you are into classic texts. But your experience for this class really relies on your GSI, who grades all of your assignments and does most of the explaining. Sells really doesn't make it an unbelievably horrible or great class.", 
            "Sells was an okay professor doing his best teaching an incredibly boring and early class. However, your grades is 100% determined by your GSI. If you aren't getting along with your GSI at first I highly suggest switching sections. This class had me in tears on multiple occasions. My best advice: DO THE EXTRA CREDIT. No matter what. It will save you",

Grading is entirely based on your GSI; make sure you get a good one!",

You will learn SO much from his class, way more than just poetry.",

It was also VERY easy;entire class grade was attendance/participation and three 7-8 page papers,which he graded lightly.", 
            "Van Dam is very passionate about what he teaches, this makes it interesting. He doesn't use lecture slides which can be irritating when he talks too quickly. Your grade depends on your GSI since he/she will be grading all of your papers and exams. Although lecture isn't mandatory I always went and found it helped me understand the readings.", 
            "Enjoyed the class and found it very interesting. By all means lecture is not mandatory and you can easily do well in the class and not go. However, discussion is necessary to do well. Fun class", 
            "Loved this class! He was a great teacher and is very knowledgeable about the material. He also made the material engaging. Lecture isn't mandatory but it's nice to go to because he's a great lecturer. Take this class if you can, it's great!", 
            "Professor Van Dam is extensively knowledgeable and very interesting to listen to. He disseminates information in a clear, concise way, and has a deep command of the material. He is willing to talk and relate with students, as well.", 
            "Crystal clear lectures with the themes and takeaway points outlined really well. Read coursepack, participate and it'll be a good class if the material interests you.", 
            "Professor Van Dam is really cool, and he is very passionate about what he teaches. The only bad experiences I had from this class were because of the GSI. Attendance isn't mandatory in lectures, but GO anyways. He explains a lot of things in the coursepack and covers a lot of important material that you can't get in discussion.", 
            "Excellent Professor, very interesting and useful lectures.", 
            "Prof. Van Dam is, without question, one of the best professors at this university. His lectures are interesting and easy to follow. He relies heavily on the course pack, as the tests you take are essay-tests based upon your understanding of the readings. Emphasizes major themes in the Roman history and ties it all together in the end. Great class.", 
            "Van Dam is a wonderful professor who loves what is is teaching. He keeps lectures interesting, although you have to attend to understand the material. The course pack is the most essential thing in this class, a must read.", 
            "Read the coursepack!!! Very important! You will have several 450 word papers throughout the semester and two exams with an essay question and quotations from the coursepack, so it's important to thoroughly read the coursepack. GSI's grade papers and exams so go to office hours and speak up in class, show effort.", 
            "Professor Van Dam is great and crystal clear in his explanations. However, it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to get a good GSI. Avoid Ryan because it is impossible to get an A on a paper in his section, whereas I've heard in other sections it's really easy to get an A on a paper. GSI=YOUR GRADE, NOT THE PROFESSOR", 
            "He is a great professor!", 
            "Great professor and very interesting class. I highly recommend taking this course even if you generally don't like history. Professor Van Dam covers all important points in his lectures and throws in some fun facts to keep things interesting. The GSI to get is Mike Leese. Great guy.", 
            "If you're not interseted in rome, then you'll hate this class. I loved it. Van Dam was a great lecturer and was easy to follow. He's also a very nice guy. Overall, my favorite class this semester.", 
            "Readings from the coursepack are annoying but the tests are based off of them. Go to a few of the lectures to have an idea of whats going on and then make sure you know the gist of each coursepack reading before the test so that you can give an opinion on the test. If you do this and are a good BSer this class won't be a problem at all.", 
            "I thought this would be an easy intro level...not at all. If you want to learn about the old Republic or early empire don't take this class. It was not at all what I was expecting for a History of Rome class.", 
            "A pretty good class. His lectures were interesting and well-structured. The tests are really straight-forward, I didn't really like my discussion section or the readings, though. But I'd still recommend it as an interesting, fairly easy class.", 
            "He is a nice guy. Lectures are good to go to. Readings can get a little tedious. Tests seem fairly straight forward. Keep up with the readings, and you'll be fine."

            "Super sweet guy but can't connect with students on a teaching level. Neither prof realizes no one knows what they are talking about. Splitting a Chegg account is almost required to do well in the class. Try to get old slides with iClicker answers from a friend because neither prof gives answers like Wayne did for 135.", 
            "Get ready for exams to cover things either unmentioned in lecture or briefly shown on a slide and never explained throughly. There is NO recognition of students struggling with any concept and lecture covers so much material in so little time you're left reeling. Mastering Physics is either incomprehensible or not used in class. Hard pass if u can", 
            "Toby is a really nice guy and a wonderful human being. I really loved having him as my Physics 340 professor. Whenever I would go talk to him, I felt like he really cared to help out and I always left pleased from my interactions with him. He's a genuinely nice guy, something that one rarely encounters in a university.", 
            "Toby is a really nice guy, but not the best professor. You pretty much have to learn the material on your own. I think that's mostly due to class setup, it's a huge lecture and there's not much time to really go in depth so he just skims. However, it's not too bad in the end because exams are very reasonable and you can do well if you study.", 
            "To be honest I never paid attention in lecture or understood the class until the day before exams. While Toby was definitely not the best professor, I think a good portion of the blame lies on us students. It is expected that you have at least skimmed the textbook before class but almost no one did. Just do lots of practice exams and you will pass.", 
            "I'm a firm believer that most of these ratings are not very accurate. Toby is a very intelligent, nice guy that seems to truly care if you understand the material. He teaches his lectures as if you have done the reading, but many people don't so they complain that they don't understand the lectures. Also, 250+ people + they're all talking over him.", 
            "Nice professor, fascinating material, boring lectures. Having a background in the course material helped a lot, because I stopped paying attention in lecture halfway in the term. Perks of taking the class in the spring: only having to suffer for 2 months. Pitfalls: having to suffer for twice as many hours a week. Also, don't buy the textbook.", 
            "Toby is a great guy and lecture is fine to sit through. He tries to keep things interesting and will make you laugh. But your success in the class is dependent on how much of the material you can teach yourself, you won't be prepared for the exams based on lectures. Get the clicker points (25%), do practice exams, watch Khan academy.", 
            "Toby knows the material, but not how to teach it. Class didn't prepare you for the exams.", 
            "Toby is a horrendous professor. I did very well in this class solely by teaching myself the practice exam material outside of class using outside resources. I did other homework in lecture because listening to Toby was a waste of time. Lecture everyday is essentially nonstop pop quizzes on material you haven't learned yet.", 
            "Horribly unclear lecturer, the book doesn't help much either. He's a nice guy and can be funny but he's quiet and generally dull to listen to. His exams are difficult but not especially fair, and no homework gets dropped. So happy to have escaped with an A-. Take it with Chupp if you can", 
            "Toby is a nice guy but not so great of a professor. 235 is definitely tougher in content and grading than 135 so Toby's lack of explanations and the lousy book made the course a lot more challenging. He often speeds through slides to get to iclicker questions which are tough; lecture is basically taking a quiz on material you don't know every day.", 
            "Lecture is a complete waste of time even though its mandatory because of iclicker. I did not learn 1 thing in this class but was still able to get A's on exams. He lectures about topics as if you already know them and paying attention in lecture does not have an impact on your performance in the class.", 
            "Worst class I have taken at this school. Dull lecturer. Explanations are not clear. So many iClicker questions and mastering physics problems. I highly recommend not taking this class with him.", 
            "Probably my worst professor at UM. His method of teaching involves having students read the textbook to learn concepts and basically answer iClicker questions throughout lecture. This wouldn't be a huge problem, except the textbook is not very good. His explanations are very unclear and usually come after already answering the iClicker questions.", 
            "Doesn't know how to bring concepts down to our level for us students learning the material for the 1st time. He skips through explaining basic concepts bc he thinks we understand them. The textbook barely matches with the material. His exams this semester are harder than past semesters with more q's on concepts than problem solving.", 
            "Very unclear, and reading the book before lecture like he suggests is only marginally helpful. Boring to listen to and not a strong presenter. Exams are haphazard in content distribution & difficult to study for, the breadth of content just encourages memorization (this is physics!) and homework takes far too much time for the points it is worth.", 
            "Toby seems like a really nice guy, but man this class in general is just poorly taught. I am near the end of this class and still don't know how to study for the exams. The lecture slides are the most useless thing ever, and the textbook isnt any better. Honestly, the only way to study for exams in this class is to learn from previous exams.", 
            "Toby is a really nice man but a really poor professor. There is no logical flow and from the first day of the semester, students became lost in the material. Every lecture, students struggle intensely with the iClicker questions. Most students sit on their phones because if you try to pay attention, you will soon be lost in the material.", 
            "Toby was awesome! The class is tough for sure, but just show up and put effort in and you'll do okay. He also curves the class a bit so you don't need to worry too much. If you have questions on the homework he is very helpful in office hours, or you can just email him and he'll get back to you pretty quickly."

            "Vicki was approachable, clear, and caring. She made learning German grammar much more interesting than I thought it would be. I enjoyed coming to class every day, and I thought that she really made the nitty-gritty aspects of German understandable. She has an interesting life that makes for great stories and an obvious love of teaching!",

            "Vicki is a great teacher. I absolutely loved her class. I learned everything I learned in high school in the first two weeks so she stays really focused. If you don't understand something, she'll explain exactly. Hate the online work, but you get used to it. Super easy.",

Graded based on a paper, 2 exams, and section. Tells great stories and has a wonderful sense of humor. For a 300 level class, workload is SO manageable and interesting. Must take class", 
            "The format of the class takes some getting used to but I grew to love it. Every lecture felt like Dr. Peters-Golden was just kind of telling some stories but in a good way. You absolutely have to attend class and take good notes because there are no recordings or slides to look ateverything is verbal. Exams are not bad at all if you pay attention.", 
            "Professor Peters-Golden is a super involved and entertaining lecturer! I think she's caught onto the fact that her class is thought of as an \"easy A\", so tests were more difficult than expected. If you go to lecture and listen, you can really get by with just studying the day before. Never used the textbook, but get the novel and culture sketches.", 
            "BEWARE: No longer a blow-off class!! Go to lecture, take notes, utilize the GSI-led exam review sessions before each test. Tests are straightforward and fair, but grading is very picky on the short answer and essay sections.", 
            "She clearly was interested in what she was talking about, and she had plenty of personal anecdotes to help explain the topics. Make sure you go to class though, because those anecdotes may appear on the exam. Exam 1 was difficult, but she and the GSIs made a conscious effort to make the next two easier and better prepare us.", 
            "Holly Peters-Golden is by far my favorite professor I have ever had. I have taken 3 classes with her, and loved all 3. She is so wise and intelligent, and her stories make class so much fun! Everyone who took this class was sad for it to end, and wished we could take it again! All you have to do is read and participate in discussion everyday", 
            "Lectures were boring & I feel like I learned nothing new, but dont expect to skip lectures & do well on the tests unless you put in the time to study (from Quizlet, review sheet, discussion notes, & readings). I got by without the textbook, but needed Getting Ghost for the essay & the Culture Sketches, which appeared in written questions on exams.", 
            "Kind of annoyingly rehearsed lectures, but she tells good stories and gives you all the material. Read culture sketches for the tests, but fairly straightforward exams. One paper assignment off of a chapter book you read on your own.", 
            "Peters-Golden is by far the most annoying professor I have ever encountered. I don't know how she has such a high rating. For the lecture on Primates, she brought in a Curious George stuffed doll and continued the entire lecture as if it were one of the books. She's patronizing and her stories are obnoxious. The lectures were painful and cringy.", 
            "Pretty clear lecturer. Tests are a little more specific than the other sections, so if you're looking for an easy A and dont want to go to lecture take them, but if you just go to lectures (dont need to do readings) you'll be fine. Her lectures are pretty interesting, and if you take basic notes w/ examples you should be able to get an easy A.",

            "She's really interesting, and I liked her lectures a lot. You don't really have to go to lecture to pass, you can just read the book, but I always went because I liked hearing the stories she tells in lecture.", 
            "Do not buy the textbook and maybe skim the culture sketches. Even going to lectures isn't a huge deal other than about one or two multiple choice questions on a test about a movie. Attending and participating in discussion sections is 15% of your grade so do that. Comprehensive study guide, so basically if you cram hard you can get the A.", 
            "I went to a total of 1 lecture (the first) and for obvious reason. It was so boring and the material is so dry and makes the students so indifferent. If you attend lecture you will be fine, but very GSI based so hope for a good GSI. if you put in some effort you'll be fine. Easy scheme just study with people and get the notes about the movies.", 
            "Would recommend to any engineer fulfilling IB credit. Lectures aren't dry, she makes them very interesting. I attended lecture 50% of the time, went to discussion every week, never did readings, and only studied the day before the exam for 2-3 hours. Also started my paper the day it was due. Ended up getting a healthy A. Easy A, don't P/F.",

There is one paper on a book, but I know people that got an A without reading it. Easy A as long as you study before the test. Would recommend if you want an easy class with a fantastic prof.",

Her lectures can get a little boring but aren't necessary to go to if you have a friend who can get the notes for you. This is a good grade booster four credit class.", 
            "Professor Peters-Golden definitley has a passion for what she does. A lot of people loved her lectures, but I found most of them boring. Her \"slides\" are just pieces of paper projected onto the screen that are very confusing and lacking a lot of detail. If you are interested in Anthro then definitely take her. There is one paper that is super easy."

She is very caring and genuinely wants students to do well. That being said, she is very aggressive and often discusses politics and takes an extremely liberal stance, trash-talking the Right Wing.",

Prof. Bardenstein is a extremely nice and helpful teacher. She is more than willing to meet with you for office hours to help out. As a first time Arabic learner, I'm glad I had her as my first professor.",

If you don't do the readings you will be lost in the class. This class will always keep you busy. Even the extra credit requires some writing!", 
            "Lectures are important to go to - lots of iClickers, but the discussions are most important and who your GSI is was very important (for this class). Bardenstein's lectures were often difficult to follow with tons and tons of words per slide, but as long as you went to discussion after that class, it didn't matter.", 
            "Grade heavily relies on GSI and discussion participationlargely effort based. The lectures were very dull and boring, but the midterm and final were super easy (she gives you a study guide of exactly what's going to be on the exams). Lots of busywork: forum posts, readings, essays. But essays can be rewritten and resubmitted (except the last one).", 
            "She was rather mediocre. Lectures were boring, dry, and very vague. This class also had a lot of required reading and busy work (e.g. forum post every week, 3 short essays, 10 page final paper). Overall, it was a pretty easy class because of lots of opportunities for extra credit and the two exams were pretty easy. Mediocre class all in all.",

It is just repetitive and the amount of work just left me dead, and not really obtaining anything from it. I tried seeing her multiple times during office hours and was waiting the entire hour, leaving not even getting to see her. Not a good class.",

Definitely take Intro to Arab Culture with her for your Upper Level Writing Requirement!!!",

Definitely take a class with him if you get the chance, you won't regret it!",

He makes it a point to learn the names of every student and always offers help and makes you feel welcome to ask questions. Holds many review sessions for homework and tests. Some weekly work and recommended readings, but not mandatory. Show up for class.", 
            "Acrisio was enthusiastic about syntax, which can be a dull subject for those not into linguistics.(misconceptions abound re: linguistics) I took 315 in the summer, which was super chill. One time we took an exam with coffee and bagels on hand and it was awesome. He was always willing to clarify and explain things further.",

The material in this class is a bit complicated at the end so I wouldn't recommend it if you don't have at least some linguistic background. The material itself is naturally very dry so unfortunately there's not much to do to make it more interesting.",

Acrisio may be dull at times, but he can be funny too. There are no surprises. He teaches you what he wants you to know, and then you're tested on it. An 'A' is DEFINITELY ATTAINABLE!!! :)",

One of the most worthless classes I've EVER taken -- shame on me for taking a class that is not even required for my major. Super easy until after the 1st exam then it's pretty much 'uhh WTF?'

Just be ready to put in effort.",

The one exam I decided to study for, I got an A.",

            "Proops is The Man. very helpful, will go over any of your papers if you just make an appointment. I didnt even worry about getting an A becuase I was so interested in the material the whole time", 
            "He seems to really enjoy teaching this subject. I also had him as the section leader, which is very nice because he will be able to answer any questions or problems you have. I have no idea what my grade is, but I enjoyed taking this class.", 
            "Really interesting lectures... Proops is funny and has a really good way of explaining things. I really loved the class. My discussion was kind of worthless, but the lectures made up for it. I definitly recommend this class- Proops is the best professor I've had so far and the class is easy and interesting.", 
            "Very funny prof who seems to enjoy teaching. However the material in the class wasn't what i thought it would be and i found it boring at times. Has nothing to do with Proops tho, who is a very good prof.",

            "Easy class. Take it if you're a philosophy major. He's also pretty funny.",

Just memorize the slides and you'll be fine, the class really is not that hard. I only ever studied a day before the exam and there's no homework except for discussion material. Straightforward and easy.", 
            "He is not a great professor, but honestly it doesn't matter. He posts all the lectures online and going to lecture is rarely helpful. That being said, this was the easiest class I've ever taken. No textbook reading is necessary, and everything comes straight from the slides. The class is boring and annoying but an easy A if you memorize the slides.", 
            "worst professor. I went to every lecture and gained nothing from them. The GSIs would make fun of how terrible Barry was as a teacher. Seems like a good guy though..", 
            "His lectures are unorganized, but he posts them online so you don't have to go to lecture. I usually went and it was somewhat helpful, and using the old exams is a great way to study. I never read the book, you just have to sit down and memorize 10-15 powerpoints and then the class is pretty straightforward.", 
            "Do not take this class with this teacher, he makes the test extremely hard on irrelevant information that is not stressed. This introductory course should NOT be this difficult! This class is very unorganized.", 
            "Barry was a great guy, but a so-so professor. Attending lecture wasn't necessary, but it was useful to clarify some of the topics. The textbook is definitely not necessary--even less so than for the other intro bio, 172. This is one of those classes where you have to memorize ten power points for each exam. If you can manage that, an A is doable.", 
            "Do not take this class, it is very unorganized and the material is very hard this year", 
            "Not a good class, very difficult. All over the place.",

            "Not good.", 
            "He just reads off of the lecture slides. You could avoid his lectures all together, read them on your own, and get the same result. His exams are very picky as well, almost to the point of irrelevance.", 
            "First of all, he made us buy a textbook with online access for over $100 and then told us that we didn't have to do the readings. Second, he reads the slides word for word without giving any supplemental info. The exams have questions that were mentioned one time and not discussed at all.", 
            "Lectures give you all the information you need for the exams. Lectures are posted online, meaning you don't have to go to class. If you are confused about something or want more detail, the textbook is a great resource. The class can get boring, but is easy especially if you put in a little time to study.", 
            "Very displeased with lecture. Literally reads off the slides, contributes nothing unique-helpful to them. Meaning I could have stayed at home. Occasionally says corny jokes. Exams are heavily slide based. Discussions aren't ever really directly related to lecture. Overall Bummer. Csp professor is much better gives helpful tips,examples. . so i hear", 
            "Slides are all on ctools which is nice. Lots of information on them. Tests have little details from the slides with no relevance. He also adds in random facts about mites to his slides...ignore that...", 
            "This class might seem easy, but it really isn't. You need to put in a lot of effort. I found reading the textbook is better than going to the lectures because sometimes the things he says has no relevance (or little). Memorize the slides and read the text and you will be fine.", 
            "172 is supposed to be harder, but I'm doing really well in that class, and worse in 171. Problem is that it's only out of 505 pts, and you have 4 exams and an essay. So to earn an A, you have to do well on all of your exams to conserve pts, which is hard if you have a tough GSI. But if you memorize all slides, you'll get least a B+ IMO.", 
            "I found some of the exam questions, particularly the written response ones, vaguely/poorly written, which led to me to getting the question \"wrong\" even though my GSI agreed with my answers. I didn't bother going to lecture. If you are somewhat good at memorizing, and spend the time to memorize all lecture slides, you'll get at least a B. Good luck", 
            "If you don't have to take this class, then run away from it. The material is relatively easy, the lectures are boring and the exams are extremely difficult. Barry is fine as a professor, its the class that everyone hates. This is not a bio class where you can learn everything the night before, and get a good grade on the exam."

His exam reviews are very thorough. If you are willing to put the effort in, DeOrio gives you all the tools you need to do well in the class.", 
            "Watch the lectures if you don't feel like going. Start the projects early and study their content for exams", 
            "I liked his lectures, pretty fun. The first three projects were new this semester, so the autograder was not acting right a few times, but they boosted the submission times to 10 times/day to compensate for these projects, which is good enough. Love his chickens' stories", 
            "For the first 3 projects in the class, the autograder was not released until 3 days before deadline which is absolutely unacceptable. Even when the autograder is released, it is not fully functional until its too late. Not only that, but the spec for the projects was not fully correct when released. Never have I taken a more disorganized class here", 
            "Deorio is a great professor that really cares about his students. His lectures are engaging and really funny, and I particularly enjoyed his chicken stories. I found his slides to be very clear and he always made an effort to clarify vague points.", 
            "Do not take a class with this lecturer. He makes exams with way too many questions for short given time. Multiple choice questions are very tricky and deceptive, full of ambiguous and long answer choices with things like None of the above and All of the above combined. Some of the answers were correct according to googling but not accepted. Avoid", 
            "Prof (Drew) DeOrio is a silly man. I find that this quality enhances instruction. There is some written material, do read it. If lectures are downloadable, you can listen to them podcast style (for review/missed lectures). Do be ready for groupwork! I'm looking at you introverts! I highly recommend this memelord.", 
            "Best professor I've had so far. You won't dread going to lecture.", 
            "I dont get the DeOrio hype. I have taken two classes with him and both classes were taught by other professors at the same time and preferred the more. I believe DeOrio definitely is not the best one to take 485 with.", 
            "engaging, funny and wonderful professor. i love eecs 280!", 
            "He is really great at keeping the content engaging. He's a pretty great professor if you're looking to actually get the content and hear some decent humor along the way.", 
            "He is an excellent lecturer on 280 but only a good lecturer on 485. I took it in WN 16 when he had full control over the course. The exams are very tricky (especially multiple choices which weren't present before he took over 485). I thought I almost failed the course due to exams but ended up with an A+... That's the trickiness you would expect.", 
            "The material is interesting but could be taught in more depth sicne web, big data, and cloud computing become increasing popular. For example, Hadoop could be practiced more and Spark could be introduced. Besides, he breezes through some important topics since the course touches almost everything a bit. Overall, a great course with huge potential.", 
            "You can tell DeOrio is passionate about teaching and he is good at it. I enjoyed taking EECS 485 with him and Jagadish co-teaching this past semester. EECS 485 is a great course, and taking it with either of these professors is a good choice.", 
            "Dr. DeOrio is the best professor that I have ever had in my four years here. He is funny (likes to talk about his chickens), clear, and very willing to meet and give feedback. He is very understanding of student's stress levels and is helpful if you put in the effort. Go to office hours if you are struggling, I guarantee he will work with you.", 
            "He simplifies things, but you still have to understand it for yourself. Always work on projects continuously - not only will that help your project grades, it will also help your exam grades.", 
            "I thought he did an incredible job of teaching the material. Did very well at breaking down the topics into easy to understand pieces. I highly recommend this class, and I highly recommend taking it with him.", 
            "Dr Deorio needs to spend more time learning the material for this course before teaching it. I've had him before and he's great when he has a mastery over the material, but he didn't and it showed. Further, he doesn't use class time well. He jam packs the material into 2/3 of the time and spends the rest of it breaking or telling stories.", 
            "Favorite teacher. Stories lighten up the class, explanations and questions in lecture are very clear and helpful.", 
            "EECS280 is an amazing class. You learn so much in so little time and it never seems overwhelming. DeOrio himself was a great lecturer and you can tell the preparation that goes into every lecture. For 280 he's the best you're gonna get. As a person he's fine (I think he tries too hard to relate/be funny) but overall positive experience"

            "Professor Silver is super enthusiastic about the material, which makes it fun to be in class and discuss English. He's really smart and has a lot of good ideas, but will tell you if he disagrees with your ideas on a book.", 
            "Lecture material has nothing to do with our papers. No guidance on what he expects out of assignments. Class is supposed to be object-based, but he just discusses plot elementsthemes in lecture. Dis-junction between material presented and the work we're supposed to produce. Grading is subjective and random, which is frustrating.", 
            "One of the worst classes that I have taken at Umich. I am shocked his ratings are as high as they are. He goes on tangents and rarely mentions assignments in class. Lectures have nothing to do with the papers. He thinks that hes hot stuff, but he is lacking as a professor.", 
            "This class was pretty bad. It had no direction or focus, it was just Prof Silver going on tangents every single lecture. Don't even bother going to them, he offers practically zero insight on the material he assigns. The papers have nothing to do with the lectures. Heck, you don't even have to read the assigned material. Very frustrating experience", 
            "Prof. Silver is always willing to meet with students outside of class and gives very prompt feedback for writing assignments. Challenges students to push themselves, but provides the support to do so. Be prepared for hilarious (and random) anecdotescommentsjokes. Take his class seriously and he will take you seriously. Great instructor.",

He does look for laughs but it\u2019s OK since he is genuinely funny. I probably laugh far too much for our 8:30 class and had too much fun for a Monday morning, but I really enjoy his personality.", 
            "Sean is one of the few professors who understands that students have a life outside of one single class. Very laid-back and understanding about deadlines. Incredible at leading a discussion. Hilarious. Loves to laugh at his students and at himself. Also a brilliant individual. Take a class with him. You won't regret it.", 
            "Sean is a great professor. He is self-aware making his jokes in class more entertaining. He tries to make his lectures interesting and often succeeds with many different formats, activities, presentations, etc. He is understanding and invested in his students' success. He is the kind of professor with which you want to take classes.", 
            "Professor Silver is a cool guy and makes the class interesting. He can be vague and unclear at times, but if you understand the main concepts, the class shouldn't be too hard. The class is different every day, so you won't be bored.", 
            "UNREAL CLASS. Worth every minute you spend with Sean - he knows so much about the material and provides so many opportunities to get hands-on experience, even in an English class. TAKE ANY CLASS YOU CAN WITH SEAN. So entertaining and funny. You forget you're in class.",

            "Sean is a good professor who cares about his students and tries to connect with them. Some of the reading can be dry, but he livens things up with powerpoints and humor. I would recommend taking a class from him, especially one on game theory!", 
            "Silver really knows how to facilitate thoughtful discussions from his students - even at 8:30 am, even when I hadn't reallly done the reading. I was pushed to think hard about the topics, but in a good way. Laid-back and friendly. He likes creative thinking, so as long as you're obviously showing thought and effort you'll do fine.", 
            "Sean is a great prof who cares about what he's teaching and cares about getting you interested. He's also completely approachable--He actually pulled me aside after I did bad on my first exam (for outside reasons) and discussed how I could improve in the class...I ended up with a B. He's also very sexy lol, and that helped keep my attention too.", 
            "He doesn't post lectures online and unless you take top-notch notes, it can be hard to follow for his exams. He makes decent powerpoints but it's a little showy with no substance. His class overall isn't hard to do that well in.. He's funny and cute. but also very unapproachable. Leaves most work to be done by his GSIs.", 
            "I don't understand all the hype over Professor Silver! His teaching style is very bizarre and overrated. He fails to account for students' difficult with the material. Doesn't respond to students' needs. Unapproachable overall."

This class is definitely hard but after doing poorly on the first exam she emailed me advice on how to do better, I met with her and she was super helpful, and when I did better on the next exam she sent me a congratulatory email. She is the most helpful professor I have had, cares about her students and is willing to help.",

The exams are definitely difficult, and require a lot of memorization over a large amount of information. However, if you put the time in, you'll do fine. Lectures put online", 
            "Her lectures are extremely disorganized. The tests are very particular and there always seems to be multiple correct answers. Lectures are a waste of time. Class could have been amazing, but she ruined a cool topic.",

Prof. RL is super helpful though. Somethings can be confusing but use her to your advantage. No expensive textbook which is great. GSI was ok, but the class was super interesting!", 
            "PRL has to be one my favorite professors at U of M. You definitely need to study for the exams but there are other grades (discussion leading, a paper, quizzes) that boost your grade. I definitely recommend this class and taking a class with PRL!", 
            "Not an easy psych class. Lectures are disorganized, exams are SO particular about tiny details and there always seem to be 2 correct answers for every multiple choice question. Also, 4 exams means that right when you've finished one, you have to start studying for the next. Overall, way too much work for this kind of class. Ruined a cool topic", 
            "The tests are pretty easy if you go over lecture slides. It is necessary though to go to and pay attention to discussion sections because there is new information presented in them that will be tested. Overall it was a very enjoyable and interesting course.",

Very disjointed, but obviously cares about the material and her students. She obviously knows the material, she just has trouble expressing it clearly.", 
            "Professor Reuter-Lorenz is one of the most impressive lecturers I have encountered at the school. This has been stimulating material and the 4 exams are not too bad if you understand the slides and take good notes. There are quizzes in discussion each week, a final 6 page paper, and a group presentation of a case study from the class text.",

The discussions are long but the class is overall very interesting. Exams are challenging but study guides make it very do-able",

Her lectures are clear and interesting. Discussion are useful, but at times are too long. Her exams aren't easy, but aren't impossible either.", 
            "Prof. RL is amazing. She is so smart and extremely willing to meet with and help out students in need. Exams are easy if you study the lecture slides well and read the book. Prof RL and the GSIs will tell you what you need to know from the book, GSIs hold a review session before each exam, and there is a study guide. Only thing that sucks is 2hr d", 
            "This class is really easy, and her exam questions come right off her lecture slides and the supplemental readings (Fractured Minds). The group presentations were frustrating to sit through because each one was at least a half hour long. The class overall was pretty good, and Dr. Reuter-Lorenz is extremely friendly and a good teacher.", 
            "R-L is a great teacher. She gets to know her students individually and loves to help them out. Exams are tough but if you understand the concepts rather than memorizing the slides they are really easy. The book is a must- there are several exam questions on the case studies. She posts her lecture PPts before class and records lectures.",

Also, a lot of the students are pre-med so if you have no neuroanatomy background like myself, be prepared to work hard in this course.", 
            "I absolutely loved this class. Professor R-L is fantastic: extremely intelligent, caring, and interactive. Her lectures are interesting and 50 minutes just isn't long enough. You are basically guaranteed an A if you pay attention in lecture and section. 2 hour discussion attendance is basically mandatory because of quizzes and group presentations."

Be forewarned though that this isn't the 161 class that used to be the Umich blowoff class. No easy A here anymore. Go to lecture and read the book and you'll be smooth sailing though.", 
            "He's very intelligent-he's one of the leading scholars on human adaptation to stressful environmental conditions. Always willing to answer questions. Class is not as easy anymore (new GSIs/exams), and his notes are often incomprehensible, so you WILL need to read the whole book to do well. He's not clear at all, but the material isn't too hard.",

            "Amazing teacher, amazing class, just amazing, easy A, class average on each test is around 90%", 
            "Never since highschool have I taken such a ridiculously easy class. The professor is interesting and he likes to tell dirty jokes during lecture. The lecture before an exam, he literally stands in front of the class with a copy of the exam and tells you exactly what is on it.", 
            "All you have to do to get an A in this class is do the review questions they give you in recitation, and read the book. There's no point to class. The professor is pretty funny, but he just follows the textbook exactly, and i mean exactly", 
            "Quite honestly one of the most interesting intro classes at the university, and Prof. Frisancho makes it worthwhile. Lectures are not mandatory, but reading the book is advised because he wrote it. I defintiely advise taking this class", 
            "I love him! He is so sweet and a really good guy. His lectures are interesting enough and he is SOOOO funny. I highly suggest taking this class!", 
            "I had mixed feelings about him and this class. I liked listening to him in lecture because he was funny, but his actual lecture material was jumbled and confusing - it really didn't help at all to attend. If you did the readings it was extremely easy to get an A, but alot of it was on CTools and not in the actual book, which was annoying.", 
            "I love Frisancho, I had him for 161, 364, and 563. He is very funny and is passionate about what he teaches. He can be hard to understand and often repeats himself and contradicts himself but if you read and go to class you will do fine.", 
            "I find this material extremely interesting as well as easy. He taught the class very well. He is funny and his lectures are worth attending although not completely necessary.", 
            "Funny guy, plus real interesting material. In my opinion, the best professor in the anthrobio department (although I haven't taken Wolpoff)",

The most caring, personal, and overall nice teacher I've ever had so far and probably will ever have at this University. Genuinely looked forward to class. There will be vocab quizzes but just study for about 30 min to an hour and you're good!", 
            "Professor Gu is really caring and super nice. As long as you do all the work and at least show some type of effort, she will respect you and acknowledge that. You don't have to be the best at Chinese but effort is valued. Really cares about her students. Vocab quizzes often but it is the nature of a language course.",

If you put in the time and effort, you will be fine. I can't tell you how great she is. She jokes around with the class all the time, and makes it great!",

She gives helpful and meaningful practice sheets to emphasize in-class learning, and she has been by far my favorite Chinese professor so far at Michigan.",

            "Extremely nice and effective teacher. I thought the class was pretty easy, but that might be because it was a class for native speakers. Because of this and her warm and friendly attitude, class was really casual, open, and almost fun. Excellent instructor!", 
            "Karen is awesome! She listens to your concerns, and brings a very enthusiastic attitude to the class. I've had a ton of fun in class, while learning lots of Chinese as well! If you put in the effort, you will do well in the class. She explains things well, and does a great job of making sure everyone is comfortable with the class. Best Teacher Ever",

I enjoyed the class as a whole and would highly recommend Great Books, and get Carrie if you can!", 
            "I adore Carrie! She was an incredible, caring teacher and was very realistic in her expectations of us. Guided class discussions were helpful. Not a super tough grader but still gave helpful feedback on my writing. I've heard so many FYWR horror stories, but this is one of the best classes I've had at Michigan! If you can, take a class with Carrie!", 
            "Great Books was a pain but Carrie was my GSI and was a bright spot in the whole experience.

The essay grading seemed arbitrary at times but if you talk to her and get to know her in office hours it magically helped.",

The class format was \"open discussions,\" but she almost always guided the class towards mindless criticism of a specific thing. Critical thought was not necessary, only hatred of the day's topic.",

            "Carrie was one of the best teachers I had this semester and I can say with nearly 100% confidence that she was the one who made the usually unbearable and hated class of Great Books enjoyable. If you can take a class with her, I recommend it.",

            "Carrie is the best professor for FYWR out there by far. It is clear that she really loves what she does and she values her students' learning above assigning grades. I hope to take another class with her in the future. Take a class with her!",

She makes it almost impossible to do poorly; you can write about whatever you want, she gives you awesome feedback, and teaches you a lot. She's very flexible about deadlines and essay criteria. Her class fulfilled my FYRW, but I will take any other class she teaches in the future.", 
            "AMAZING. Da Real MVP. Literally the best. The only GSI to take Great Books with. She could teach the class. She cares about you as a person and about improving your writing. If you show up and turn your assignments in there is no reason you can't get an A. 1010", 
            "Really helpful, kind, and extremely open minded. She makes this class a lot more enjoyable. I switched to her discussion even though the time kept me in class later on fridays but it was so worth it. Don't think twice - easier grader and super helpful",

She's so nice too, will really do anything to help, and accepts any interpretation of the text that may be different from hers. Really understanding that life gets busy with other classes, and an easy grader. Had her for both GB 1 and 2 :)",

We have a group project to design which was introduced in WN 2017.", 
            "HWs are long, might take 15-20 hours a week depending on the level of understanding you have over the topic. Would strongly suggest attending recitations, GSI hours to make your life easier with HWs. Lectures are organized systematically. Exams are not that tough compared to HWs and are graded generously. Overall a great professor, awesome GSIs",

Office hours are practically required but the GSIs are great. Exams are tough but reasonable and very generously graded. Lectures are long but Orosz makes them interesting with videos, etc.", 
            "Professor Orosz is good at explaining the material and is, in general, a good lecturer. The homeworks for the class desperately need revision, since some of them are unreasonably difficult in terms of algebra and calculation, to the point of obscuring the concept you're supposed to be learning.",

The amount and difficulty of the assignments are reasonable. All the challenging problems are set as optional problems, so it won't be too time-consuming. The exams are based on the homework.",

Additionally, he does NOT assign grades fairly. Very tough class, would be better if he stuck to consistent and fair grading.",

Furthermore, he's taken the time to condense the textbook into very useful notes that serve as great study guides for the exams. A very rare and giving personality. This guy makes U of M look good.",

            "Professor Bailey making class interesting by bringing in guest speakers and sharing stories from her professional work that keep class interesting. Material is something I was already interested in but this class took it to the next level. Would recommend this class to anyone with any major no matter of sex.", 
            "You would learn a lot from this class if you do not already know the basics of women's studies and feminism, but if you do, then the class is pretty boring. Joanne is not a very captivating lecturer, so even though the information is interesting, it is hard to pay attention. Good class if you know nothing about feminism, otherwise kind of boring.", 
            "She's by far the best lecturer I've had at this school. The class is until 7:30 pm and I'm wide awake through the whole thing. If you do the readings (minimal) go to class and listen then you'll do well. Unless you're terrible at writing papers, especially since the GSIs grade those and if you get a tough grader you're going to have a tough time.", 
            "You will not regret taking this class. I learned so much from Joanne, and found her lectures super interesting. Your grade depends largely on your GSI.", 
            "Joanne is not only a very informative lecturer, but also makes her 2-hour lecture very interesting. I never fell asleep once in that class. Grading criteria is very clear and all the GSI's are very supportive and caring. Highly recommend this class to any pre-health students out there.", 
            "Bailey was a great professor, however, the GSIs were tough graders, sometimes unreasonably. Extra credit is offered, but not if you participate and attend class. This was not communicated to me so I wasted my time on extra credit. Sometimes the readings were boring and trivial, but Bailey's lectures were great. Recommend for someone interested.", 
            "Good lectures, funny, knowledgable, great GSI's and discussions", 
            "Joanne is amazing!! Favorite class so far! Easiness depends on GSI. I had the hardest grading GSI so I finished with a B+, but I love the discussion she lead. Going to class was never something I dreaded (lecture and discussion). Take Joanne's class, you will not regret it!", 
            "WS 220 is an amazing class that changed my outlook on the world. The class' easiness depends on your GSI--I earned an A without discussion but I had a tough GSI so I got an A- in the class. The content is great, but there is too much hand-holding/discussion assignments for the research paper. There is extra credit if you go to events on campus", 
            "Very easy class even if you miss lecture. Just make sure you look over lecture notes. Easy A if you have a good GSI. All paper grading is done by GSIs and papers are the majority of the grade. Midterm and final are easy if you read the course guide and look at lecture notes that always get posted.", 
            "i went to the first lecture and got an A by just skipping lectures, reading my course guide, looking over posted lecture notes, and doing well in discussion. if you know a bit about feminism you're fine to not go to lecture.", 
            "She is a very knowledgable and genuine professor. That being said, the material is extremely boring to sit through for 2 hours so if you forget to listen during lecture the tests become harder. All memorization for tests, and grade depends on GSI. Easy class but my GSI graded papers really tough which hurt my grade.", 
            "Professor Bailey is amazing and you can really tell she loves what she's teaching! That being said, your grade completely depends on your GSI. I got a really tough GSI, and there are very few assignments so you can't really redeem your grade easily. VERY small workload :)", 
            "Your grade in the class depends a lot on your GSI. That being said, Joanne ran the class really well, and I enjoyed attending her lectures. The material is always relevant, and I'm glad I took the class.", 
            "One of the best classes Michigan offers. The material is really interesting and Bailey is a wonderful lecturer with great readings, guest speakers and presentations. My GSI was a tough grader, and I've heard the same for the others, but had great discussions and super helpful in office hours. Recommend this class for anyone!", 
            "Joanne is a wonderful teacher and human being who is knowledgable and passionate about what she teaches. Take class with her, she makes it worth your while!"

            "Best Professor to ever walk at the University of Michigan. Truly a shame that he is leaving the university, such a big loss for the community. Truly an influence on my life, and he will always be remembered at the University of Michigan. He left the university with a bang. If anyone ever has a chance of meeting him, I would do so. AMAZING PROFESSOR",

            "I took this class because I'd heard Professor Williams was teaching the section on Christianity, and there's so much hype about him, but Prof. Jackson is BY FAR a better teacher. His lectures are engaging and crystal clear. He is both humorous and to the point, wheras the other two professors in this course are incredibly hard to follow.", 
            "Best lecturer I have ever heard! Takes confusing info on Islam and makes it crystal clear. Professor does not have office hours so all questions must go to GSI. Mid term not difficult(haven't had final yet), but also need to write a 10 page research paper.", 
            "Very Engaging Lecuturesss..i luved going to his class",

            "I think people come into linguistics believing they can get an easy A, so they feel ripped off when they discover that the course actually makes you work for a grade. I'll be honest when I say that I came in not quite sure about the field, but by the end I gained an appreciation for linguistics and I owe it all to Professor Coetzee!", 
            "Hilariously basically accidentally told us that Linguistics is useless for our futures. Easy to get an A-, but tough to get an A because Coetzee makes a 94+ an A. Got a 93.8 with him a year ago and he didn't round up. Overall, easy 3 credit course but assignments and take home exams are miserable. Attendance is enforced and no electronics allowed.", 
            "Great professor! I'm not a Linguistics major, but the class proved to be surprisingly useful down the road. Lecture can be dull at times, but he tries his best to make the material interesting. If you show up and occasionally review, you should get an A.", 
            "Linguistics is extremely boring and Professor Coetzee doesn't make it interesting. HW assignments are miserable, but not hard. 2 take home exams with no time limit so easy As, but plan to be bored to death by the class and Coetzee. Additionally, he enforces attendance through Iclikers and has the GSIs babysit and watch if any electronics are used.",

            "To my understanding this used to be an easy class. Now they have unreal expectations and grade extremely hard. A lot of the class is online but still not an easy A. I ended up with an A- because I messed up on one small part of an exam. If you do take this class, take it with other people, makes it a lot easier to understand.", 
            "A lot of people told me to take this class because it is \"an easy A\". Well they lied. This class requires you to do so much work, and the professor and gsis grade extremely hard. Avoid taking this class at all costs!",

            "What I anticipated to be a very easy class ended up being pretty difficult. I really didn't put in that much effort, but it hurt me down the stretch. An A is not hard to come by if you put in the work, but it's easy to not show up and participate because attendance is just based on Piazza polls.",

Great guy, loved his Afrikaans accent!",

            "Andries is super nice. He really wants you to find the subject interesting and the class is an easy A if you do all the homework and go to lecture most of the time. Grading is extremely fair and the workload is light. Also his accent is great.", 
            "Pretty good professor and grades class generously. Class is pretty simple as long as you do all the HW assignments with someone and know what you're doing during his exams. Getting an A is not hard as long as you pay attention. Also loved his accent at lecture",

            "While the subject matter is difficult, Andries is a great teacher. He may go quickly in class, and expects a lot from his students, but is more than willing to sit one-on-one until you understand the material. If he knows you are putting in an effort, he definitely grades fairly.", 
            "Andries is fantastic. He takes a somewhat boring subject matter and makes it interesting. It seems like every assignment he gave was very hard, but then he would send out further instructions on how to do it. He is very flexible with the syllabus/schedule, and even cancelled our final.

Fair bit of reading but it's not unreasonable.", 
            "I took the Honors section so I had to write an extra 15 page paper, but he makes sure that you are on track so you don't wait until the last minute. There are four essay quizzes throughout the semester, but he'll pretty much hint at those and you'll ahve a good idea of what they're on. If you go to office hours he'll give you clues for finals.",

            "Professor Vinovskis seems like a nice guy. That being said his lectures are terribly boring. He doesn't use any online resources and just projects some notes on an overhead. If you don't go to lectures only way to get notes is from someone else. All quizzes and exams are essays.",

This was a tough class because it was sort of a history class taught in Spanish. (SPAN 232 - 055 Argentina a Cuba)",

Overall, a great class taught by an incredible professor for those willing to put in the work.", 
            "She does give a lot of work, but it's manageable and it's the reason why your Spanish skill increases so much. I used to be an average speaker, but I can now speak the language pretty confidently. She's super friendly and will help you with any questions you have on the material.",

I learned a lot.",

            "If you don't love literature you are toast. She will lecture you about developing a wide range of views on literature and appreciating the texts you read while advancing a single interpretation of the text that she will not waiver from. If you get Mira, change seminars because virtually all of her students are terrified of her.", 
            "It's her way or the highway. Read the texts, listen to her interpretations in lecture, and regurgitate her opinions on the papers and exams and you'll get an A. It's not as bad a class as everyone says if you're able to read overwhelming volumes of ancient texts.", 
            "She's really enthusiastic and funny, but the organization of her notes is iffy and she goes too fast sometimes. The class is honestly not that bad, though there's a lot of reading. People just like complaining about it. She's helpful during office hours and just a cool person to talk to.", 
            "The hardest part of this class was not being able to use laptops and somehow keeping up with her fast paced powerpoints. I ended up going to lecture to see her outfits after I realized I write too slow. That being said, she actually explains the themes and concepts pretty well.", 
            "There is absolutely no point of lecture. The only thing that matters is your GSI. They grade your papers and exams. Mira Seo is really smart and super helpful in office hours. Lectures aren't helpful and sparknotes will probably be your best friend. I think Carrie and Jared are the best GSIs. Try to get one of them.", 
            "Good, engaging speaker, but the lectures were not particularly helpful in understanding the texts, as a lot of it was plot summary; the lectures were more or less like reading the sparknotes.", 
            "So much reading in the class that its not even worth it to read. Just go to discussion and sparknote and you'll be fine.", 
            "Professor Seo is clearly very passionate about the subject. The reading pace was incredibly fast, however. Having a good GSI is incredibly important.", 
            "I dreaded those 9AM lectures like no other. No laptops allowed, so you have to really work to try and get down everything on the slide, which was a lot in a short amount of time. The powerpoints themselves were unorganized and just not great lecture notes. She's really passionate about the subject! You really just need a good GSI, though.", 
            "Mira is a good lecturer, but she assumes a pretty high level of interest in her students. The lectures are not necessary to do well in the class. Read the books and the class is pretty smooth. The GSI really makes or breaks the class (Shout out to James Bos, arguably the best GSI ever).", 
            "Prof. Seo didn't really seem to prepare much for her lectures, and if she did they weren't helpful. Mostly, they are a re-cap of the reading and they are a bit unorganized and all over the place. She reiterates the same points over and over and the lecture is completely pointless to go to most the time. Alot of reading", 
            "Professor Seo lectures very quickly, but if you know how to take notes, then you're golden. Her exams weren't hard at all, but the papers were graded on a pretty difficult scale. She is very helpful and informative, especially if you take the time to visit her in her office hours.", 
            "Professor Seo's lectures definitely take some getting used to, but as long as you're willing to take notes quickly and do some reading on your own, you can learn a lot. The GSIs are really helpful but you have to go see them in person, definitely not a class if you want to get spoon fed.", 
            "Prof. Seo was great! Her lectures were fast, but interesting. She has a very captivating attitude. There was a lot of reading/work, though...imagine reading 100s of pages of Greek history per night.", 
            "Her lectures were of no use whatsoever...", 
            "-", 
            "She spends way too much time getting dressed for class than preparing an insightful and useful lecture. Don't, I repeat, don't take this class. You'll dread it three weeks into the class. When people say take ClassCiv instead of Greatbooks, believe them. It's the right thing to do. There's way too much reading and not enough help in writing essays.", 
            "Her lectures are basically an audio file of Sparknotes. She says nothing profound, and her lecture slides can be hard to follow. She's nice, kind of bubbly. But lectures were basically useless. Might as well go to Sparknotes. Except for one text because there were no available. She should spend less time getting ready in the morning.", 
            "Professor Seo was good enough of a lecturer, but most people discovered early on that attendance wasn't necessary for a good grade. Most of the topics covered in lecture, I already knew, minus fancy greek terms. GSI's do all the grading, so it all depends on if you get a good one.", 
            "I was really dreading this class until I heard Prof Seo's first lecture! She is fascinating, funny, passionate, and really cares about the material and getting to know her students. She's a great professor who made a previously dreaded class into one of my favorites!"

            "Don't take notes in Stam's class. You'll absorb a lot more by listening closely and doing the readings. Tests are all based on the readings, so go to section. Stam's lectures were always really interesting. He makes sure to answer questions and has a very dry and sarcastic sense of humor. Highly recommend him.", 
            "Interesting lectures, but basically of no importance to any of the exams. Very unorganized.", 
            "Prof. Stam is very knowledgable and has excellent lecturing skills. However, this class from an administrative aspect was a joke. The lectures consisted of random, highly specific information that wasn't on exams, he didn't cover the book but you still had to read it, section was worthless, he didnt follow the syllabus and exams were poorly written", 
            "Definitely one of my favorite professors I've had so far. Great lecturer. Enthusiastic and keeps things interesting. I even looked forward to going to class. Not sure what he's like in a smaller class setting, but great for a large lecture.", 
            "Probably my favorite teacher to ever exist. Lectures are actually enjoyable. Some topics can be a tad dry but he does a fantastic job of making them interesting. Had him for POLSCI 160 as well and did well. Definitely a prof that prepares you for the real world.", 
            "He was an interesting professor but honestly I did not like this class. Other GSI's were probably more helpful than mine but still it was a frustrating class. For one he doesn't post lecture slides and on top of the lecture is kinda all over the place. Also, my GSI was not helpful and I would say was even misleading on what we should study.", 
            "He is an extremely bias professor. Refuses to post slides but goes through them way too fast in class to ever copy down all of the notes. Reading is absolutely necessary as you will be tested on things from the reading that you never talk about in class or section. Definitely not the best class to take.", 
            "Stam seems intimidating but is secretly a really good teacher and shows real-world applications of his class. Very sarcastic and blunt. Not sure how many of us are getting A's, but if you make an effort you shouldn't fail. Go to lecture - they're really interesting and the readings are ignored. He has great personal stories.", 
            "One of the most interesting profs at umich. Would definitely take any class of his. Makes lectures easy to understand, only down fall is there's heavy use of the textbooks so you HAVE to read. Total badass though.", 
            "Classes covered a wide range of topics-- kept it interesting. It definitely was a plus that he didn't do the grading! It is impossible to get a hold of him, but the GSI was more than helpful if we needed it. Good class (UMMA Auditorium didn't hurt either!!)", 
            "Professor Stam is awesome. He is extremely smart and accomplished yet humorous at the same time. I would take any course with him. He is willing to meet outside of office hours and if you are interested in the Political Science field he is totally there to help you. Also, very sexy man.", 
            "Fun class to go to. Since he does none of the grading, it's relatively easy. However, there are a fair amount of assignments. Overall, interesting lectures and he's very funny.", 
            "Great prof. Makes some mistakes and generalizations about regions he doesn't know. However, he is entertaining and lectures go by fast.", 
            "Great.", 
            "Entertaining and lecture very well. Provides power points and podcasts. At the same time, does not give a damn about his students. He just does not care, yet he is still one of the most fascinating professors I have ever had. I would take a class with him again. Make sure to come to lectures.", 
            "I loved professor Stam. He was really funny, and his knowledge of the subject seemed infinite. I didn't mind the 9 o'clock class because he was a great lecturer. His head GSI got better as the semester progressed.", 
            "I would take any class prof. stam teaches. He's funny/interesting and worth getting up for at 9:00am. GSI does make a big difference because they the grade essays", 
            "Stam is a great; he makes waking up at 9AM (most of the times) worth it. He's pretty engaging and the material in the lectures is really interesting. However, I feel like what section/GSI you get is going to affect your experience in the class. I had a great GSI, so I loved the class, but some of my friends had the head GSI and had an awful time.", 
            "Great teacher, lectures are really funny. The tests are fairly easy, and the papers are really precise. There is a lot of reading, but if you know the main concepts it's not really mandatory to read everything in depth. He's really smart and makes you want to learn world politics."

            "Fricke is absolutely incredible. Obviously--he's an ENFP. He knows Nepali and tells captivating stories about his work in the himalaya. His class feels like book club on crack. God, just an overall fantastic human. Always left discussion with a happy heart-mind.", 
            "Professor Fricke is the most passionate lecturer you will ever meet. You will leave this class with a deep appreciation for cultural anthropology and humans in general. Fricke tells a lot of interesting stories about his fieldwork in Nepal and Nebraska. Study guides are given for exams. Grade is based partially on a photo project. Go to lecture!!", 
            "Tom Fricke wants you to get an A. He makes that clear in the beginning and puts your concerns at ease. My GSI gave us the exam questions in a review session for class, so I would say this class was an easy A.", 
            "Prof Fricke really cares about his students and wants you to pass. Go to office hours if you can because he's a really cool guy and the review sessions before tests will be a godsend. Lectures aren't mandatory but he's a good speaker and although it's an easy A, its a fun course", 
            "This guy is amazing, take this class with him. He is an easy A, just read through the material a couple days before the exam and you should be fine.", 
            "Great teacher. Cares about student. Go to review sessions and you'll be fine.", 
            "Professor Fricke is great. He's interactive, funny, and values interesting and dynamic lectures. This is a great class to take- easy A. The tests are extremely straightforward and if you attend review sessions you will be golden. I found the assigned readings to not be very necessary to be successful in the class.", 
            "Professor Fricke is certainly very passionate and enthusiastic about anthropology. He's also quite approachable and fun to talk to if you're interested in going to office hours.", 
            "First, Fricke is an amazing professor with enthusiasm and funny stories. However, this class is a joke. I got an A simply by reading the online slides and going to the review lectures. The class contains common knowledge for any college level student. Reading is \"required.\" Discussions give away all the answers from the exam, so don't even bother.", 
            "He was awesome, he just wanted students to learn what he had to offer instead of making them do a ton of difficult work. Really, a fabulous class with an amazing prof.", 
            "You'll find that you don't need to go to lecture to do well in the class, but you will go anyways because Professor Fricke is one of those professors that only comes around once in a while. Just do yourself a favor and take this class.", 
            "Very fun guy", 
            "Tom is the greatest! We read some of the most interesting books and watch some really great documentaries. If you are lucky enough to take a class with this guy, do it, you won't regret it and it is an easy A.", 
            "Going to all lectures is not a must but helps a little when studying for the exams avg around A-...Theres two essays, graded with a median being of about a B+...Overall class grade average is A-/B+...If you attempt to go to lecture/attend his office hours before the exams you will easily get the A in the class.",

            "Professor Winn is, without question, the worst professor I've ever had at the University of Michigan. He's scattered and can not clearly present relevant material. The textbook is the only thing that stopped me from failing. Take 405 with literally anyone else. I'm pretty sure I understand less having finished the course than I did after 260.", 
            "Winn is an amazing lecturer, and the perfect mix between funny and awkward. Quizzes can be hard, but the lowest grade is dropped and there is lots of extra credit available. If you do enough Problem Roulette and don't cheat with iClickers, you can get an A.", 
            "Fantastic lecturer. Professor Winn constantly makes the class laugh. He also does a great job of making highly complex physics concepts seem immensely simpler. If you are about to take Physics 240, I HIGHLY recommend you take it with Professor Winn. Plus he always wears socks and chacos, which is undoubtedly the greatest outfit in existence.", 
            "This guy could be the most awkward professor I've had to date, but he's an incredible lecturer. Probably one of the few collegiate lectures actually worth going to without additional incentives.", 
            "Great lecturer. The grading in his class is based on only 6 quizzes, with the lowest quiz grade dropped. There is extra credit for showing up to class and answering iClicker questions as well as doing the homework.", 
            "He is by far the most amazing professor I ever have at UofM. He is very caring about his students and want us to get As in the class. He is very helpful during the i-clickers and try to help us as much as possible. He is funny, generous, and has a cute sense of fashion. Physics 240 is supposed to be a hard class but he makes it worth it.", 
            "I wasn't a fan of Professor Winn. Even though he's funny during lecture, his teaching is always heavy on the theoretical material and he never covers any problems with math (which is what most of the homework/exams is based on). Only good part of this class is that the extra credit can significantly raise your grade (brought me from B+ to A).", 
            "Prof Winn's jokes and quirky personality made 9am lecture worth it. The material is tough, but you'll do well if you start your hw early and go to office hours (camp out in the Physics Help Room). He recommends doing Problem Roulette to study, but I redid the hw & lecture slides. DO THE PRELECTURES! easy points + makes life SO much easier trust me", 
            "Overall he's a really solid professor. He's funny and makes jokes in class but also covers the material thoroughly and at a good pace. He has very strict grading criteria which he clearly lays out at the beginning of the term but he also has no leeway for bumping up grades", 
            "Winn is a fantastic lecturer. He's excited about the material, and he's excited to teach it. He also keeps it engaging with demos and a great witty sense of humor.", 
            "Professor Winn is probably my favorite professor so far at U of M. He has a very solid grasp of the material, explains things incredibly clearly and completely, and is entertaining in a kind of dorky and adorable way. He clearly has a love for what he teaches and that passion certainly rubbed off on me. He makes me truly love the material.", 
            "Dr. Winn is the man. I dreaded 240 the summer before school started, but I'll tell you it is the class I look forward to every day. Winn is an amazing lecturer. I rarely leave his class confused. His humour is very clever and always has the class laughing. I will definitely miss having his class.", 
            "Professor Winn is one of my favorite professors at the university! His lectures are super helpful. Many people complain that 240 is super hard but the key to the class is completing the preflights and checkpoints before lecture. The difficult topics are covered in class with the expectation that students completed the pre-class assignments.", 
            "I doubt there is an instructor at Michigan who cares more about his/her students than Dr. Winn. He puts a great deal of time into lectures and his effort shows. Winn really wants students to learn the material and gives students willing to work many opportunities to do so. If you have the opportunity to take 405 with Winn, do it!", 
            "Professor Winn is without a doubt the best professor for Physics 240. He is so passionate about what he is teaching that it makes it easy to pay attention. His explanations are clear and thorough. He gives plenty of difficult examples in class that make it easier to understand exam problems. Bonus, his humor is classic.", 
            "I took Phys 240 my first semester at UM and it was certainly my favorite class that semester because of Dave Winn. Winn was hilarious and engaging in class, and was helpful in understanding the material. He also was incredibly accessible via email and Piazza, as well as during office hours.", 
            "Amazing Professor. He's extremely helpful in office hours and on piazza. People say his tests are hard but if you pay attention in class(which is not to hard to do here) the tests are not that bad at all. Can't go wrong having him.",

            "Professor Kurdak's Physics class was very fun! It was an everyday physics class so we did labs every day. No text book, 4 homework assignments all semester, a midterm, and a final. I completely bombed the final because it had nothing to do with anything we learned all semester but other than that, great class and great prof", 
            "I love him! His high pitched voiced and mannerisms are funny. I took him for \"everyday physics\", so he didn't expect you to know much, but I feel like you still had to know physics concepts to get through. It wasn't easy, but pretty manageable. The concepts were cool if you like physics, i dislike physics so blah.", 
            "Worst Professor I have ever had. Attendance was required and I hated every moment I spent in that classroom.", 
            "Professor Kurdak is a nice person. He's always willing to answer questions after class and really has fun with the topics. He believes in teaching what we will remember since he wants you to use what you've been taught. This makes exams a little bit harder, since exams are more theoretical and Professor Kurdak likes a practical view of physics.", 
            "I felt extremely betrayed after every one of his exams. He would teach the bare minimum, assign the easiest homework, tell the class that certain concepts are completely useless then expect complete mastery of everything he told you not to learn. He has no idea what will be on the exam since his colleague writes them so expect to feel unprepared.", 
            "Prof. Kurdak was a great lecturer. People say that his tests were \"impossible\", but most things seem impossible when you do not try. Like many other profs at Michigan, Kurdak liked focusing on concepts. Just read the book.", 
            "Tests are insane. He talked about metaphors that didn't help students understand the materials. There were times where he simple said \"I don't know why you learn this\". It would've been easier to just read the book. Mastering Physics problems became ridiculous at one point due to lack of useful lecture time. He might be smart but he cant teach", 
            "Terrible class. Tests are impossible. Kurdak certainly doesn't help at all", 
            "He is the best lecturer who i have ever seen.", 
            "Hilarious Lecturer. Has extremely large pitch range with voice and likes to talk about Blue's Clues to explain concepts. Slightly crazy but has cool demos. Homework was annoying (online) but easy. Tests were not as bad as everyone made them out to be although sometime the average was a bit low (60's)", 
            "Very energetic and definitely understands the material. At times, he's a little confusing but that's why this course has a textbook! He teaches completely from the textbook. If possible, read ALL the chapters and you will do great on exams. Make sure you understand the homework. Study hard because he likes to ask conceptual questions on exams.", 
            "Although his exams were difficult to ace, his final curve was extremely generous. I was dreading the subject before the class, but I actually came to enjoy it while taking the class. Kurdak is a good professor. The most unpleasant part of the class was mastering physics homework.", 
            "Most definitely the worst professor I have ever had. Yes he is a nice man, Yes he is around to talk to you about problems you have. Down side, he writes his tests without reading the book, the class requires calc 3, and he requires partial diff eq on the tests, to smart for the students good. Explains things by saying, you just look at it and yo", 
            "I jump up and down...I'm a light bulb! This guy was amazing. Yes, the exams were killer, but if you actually studied and understood the conceptual ideas, the class was very easy and useful. Most people think they can just write as many equations as possible onto their exam notecard and still understand them. Analogies make the lecture exciting.", 
            "Hard to understand in lecture, but very helpful if you can stand his accent.", 
            "This class was absolutely fantastic! Kurdak is a kind of professor who was extremely focused on the concept! I think it was very easy class to take..!", 
            "This guy is out of his mind. The lectures might be fun to go to (required, anyway), but it's definitely not worth it when it comes to exams. He doesn't even read the book, so he has virtually no idea which equations we know and do not, making a lot of the problems extremely difficult. I would recommend not taking this class or taking it elsewhere.", 
            "THE WORST EVER when it came to exams, I saw three girls crying after his disastourously impossible exams..He's ok otherwise. If u have any sense AVOID IT at all costs (last exam average:50.78 percent !!)", 
            "Absolutely hilarious. You will laugh out loud at some of his analogies. Great professor too -- really smart, really knows his stuff and is great at explaining it in a huge lecture. But his exams are impossibly difficult.", 
            "Definitely gives an entertaining lecture. I have some female professors with a deeper voice. That being said, lecture is informative, and he gives you the important concepts, formulas, and examples. Not so helpful reviews before exams (i.e. just goes over the practice exam), and the exam averages have been around 60. Good professor, bad class."

            "Prof. Ulaby is easily the best professor I have ever had. His primary goal is for his students to learn the material and its real world significance. If you pay attention and do the assignments, you will learn the material and you will earn a good grade. He is very passionate and does a good job of getting students interested in electromagnetics.", 
            "He wrote the textbook that you use and is very clear about the subject. You can see his passion for Electromagnetics in lecture and his homework problems are not that bad. He knows who attends class and who doesn't. Doesn't tolerate late people or ones who skip. You don't need the textbook because of lecture but it helps. Great Professor!", 
            "Professors don't get any better than this. Genuinely cares about his students. Keeps perspective on the big picture of what engineers do, which is very inspirational and helpful. One of the foremost experts in his field. Lectures are fantastic. Wants to see his students do well and shows it. Class was a lot of work. I came away a huge fan.", 
            "Great professor. Cares that you focus on learning the material rather than stressing out about the grade. If you are an EE, you miss out if you don't take at least one class with him.", 
            "Professor Ulaby is by far the best professor I've had at Michigan. He's super nice, inspirational and knows the material. His lectures are clear, and he's always willing to help. He cares about the students learning the material. I wish he could teach every EE class.", 
            "THE best professor I have ever had in my four years in college", 
            "Take any class he teaches, no questions asked. He is great and really cares about all of his students. Plus he really does grade holistically. His books (especially the electromagnetics one) are also very helpful.", 
            "EECS 215 is one of those courses that many students dread. However, Ulaby made it manageable when he taught it. He probably won't be teaching 215 anymore, but you should definitely try to take a course from him at some point in your EE undergraduate career. You will need a good work ethic to do well in his class, but you really will learn a lot.", 
            "He's as great as everybody has been saying. 330 is much better than 230. You can still get a good grade in 330 even if you didn't do that great in 230. The material in 330 is VERY USEFUL no matter what area in EE you do. This class should be considered as pseudo-required for all EE's. Also, you don't need to get a new book if you got it for 230.", 
            "You want to have him at some point in your undergraduate EE career. His class is the best I have ever taken. Ulaby wants you to focus on learning rather than grades, and will consider your effort as part of the evaluation. 330 with him was mainly project based, and you will have a much better experience compared to 230 lab.", 
            "Great professor. Take any EECS class with him and you will not regret it. He takes into consideration your effort when assigning grades. If you are an EE and don't take a class with him, you are really missing out!", 
            "If you take 215, take it with Ulaby. He is a genius. When I had him he was about to take a sabbatical to research non-invasive methods of breaking up cancerous tissue. He is a great lecturer and cares about his students. I failed because I didn't study enough for exams and he was still incredibly supportive. Ulaby will never make you feel stupid.", 
            "My 2nd class with the big boss of EECS. Easily the best professor I've had. Workload is very high but he grades fairly and holistically so your hard work is never in vain. Has amazing knowledge about the material and will constantly connect the material from the book to real life applications and examples. All professors need to be like Ulaby.", 
            "Prof. Ulaby is the man! His teaching is fantastic and he cares a lot whether you learn or not. Very organized in his materials. The class is not easy but not too complicated if you are a daily based working student. He considers even his teaching assistants and their concerns a lot.", 
            "Professor Ulaby is a phenomenal teacher. I thoroughly enjoyed his class and 215 being an introductory class, he goes out of his way to help the students understand material. He sets up one on one meetings. He makes sure that you understand the material more than caring about a grade,as he feels that anybody can achieve a good class.Take this class!",

His textbook is really good too. Class isn't hard but workload is very heavy and he tells you this at the beginning. Do all your homework (on your own) and you'll be fine on exams."

            "I would walk into class every day hoping, just hoping, that Kabamba would prove me wrong about how bad of a teacher he was. And every day I was in fact disappointed. He maybe a smart guy but that doesn't mean he should be teaching. His homework, tests, quizzes, and term project do not correlate with what he focuses on. He shouldn't be teaching AERO", 
            "Before I took this class, I wanted to be an aerospace engineer. Unfortunately, 201 with Kabamba seriously shook my confidence. The homework, the exams, the term project and the lecture are totally unrelated to each other. The textbook is poorly written, but you get more out of reading it than watching him derive equations on the board all lecture.", 
            "These other ratings are spot on, he's an awful professor for an introductory course. He drives students to sleep every lecture by just deriving formulas in the most abstract ways possible. Half of the material from the midterm had absolutely nothing to do with Aero, and tested your understanding of matrix algebra and trigonometric rules.", 
            "I can't even explain how bad this guy's class is. Avoid This guy if possible. The lectures are a terrible waste of time. He doesn't actually teach, he just fills the whiteboard with random proofs. He often teaches HW material after the HW is due. The exams are random and impossible to study for. For a guy who makes 140k/year, he teaches like a bum.", 
            "Avoid at all costs. Seems to be a smart guy, absolutely terrible teacher. Be ready to absolutely hate being called 'astute'. Homeworks, lectures, and exams to not correlate. Just because its on the exam doesn't mean it was covered in lecture. Necessary information for hw will be covered a couple days after hw is due.", 
            "Absolutely terrible. I have no idea of how the Aero department allows him to teach. Exams, homework, projects are totally random and absurd. Classes are more like hypnotic therapy sessions (I mean it, impossible to stay awake), but he still expects students to give him \"a sounding YES\". Final is up, and hopefully I'll be done with this nightmare.", 
            "I was very excited to take this class until a few weeks in. The professor makes the course a real challenge. Homework and tests are very unpredictable as they may or may not relate directly with the lecture. you never know what to expect when preparing for the tests since they often cover things that are barely talked about. You better be astute!", 
            "Kabamba is a smart guy but a really bad professor. He treats us like elementary school kids. Exams are very unpredictable as no practice exams were given at all. You copy a ton of equations and they never come in handy. It's rocket science and we know we have to work hard, but please don't drive us to sleep in class.", 
            "Professor Kabamba is very enthusiastic and seems to love everything aerospace and physics. He will keep you laughing in class. He is very thorough and concise. He expects hard work from students, but is very reasonable in his expectations. Tests were slightly difficult, but very fair. Averages were in the high 80's and 70's.", 
            "He's fairly entertaining, but his class is HARD you need to use the book to supplement the lecture and PAY ATTENTION. There is a new equation basically every 5 minutes.",

Also, I'm still not sure why logic was put into this course...his only explanation so far has been \"because your competitors at Georgia Tech and MIT aren't learning it\"",

He said- he will regrade at the end of the semester only if it changes your total grade by 4%!!!! This is his so-called 4% rule. I heard he is a good grad-level teacher- but it doesn't matter in undergrad level.",

Expect much apathy, irrelevant lectures, absurdly lengthy homework, and a mysterious grading system.",

            "Thad Polk is the man. Super funny guy, makes lectures very interesting and engaging. One of the best classes I've taken", 
            "The subject is boring but easy class nonetheless. I would take the class again. Just study every term and know the difference. The paper is curved so life is good :) Love ya Polk", 
            "Great class! Intro course, so a lot of history, but Prof. Polk makes even the most mundane details fun to listen to. 10/10 would recommend.", 
            "Best professor at this university. Do not take PSYCH 240 with anyone besides Polk. So knowledgable, so engaging, such useful sections. Also has awesome clips of the day. Tests can be challenging but you know what's on them beforehand because of how clear his study guides are. Not an easy A but definitely a class you just want to succeed.", 
            "Professor Polk made lecture material that could have been boring, seem extremely interesting. During lecture, he keeps you engaged with a great sense of humor, fun videos, and demonstrations that keep you involved, all while teaching us the material clearly. If you go to class and pay attention, it would be hard not to pass.", 
            "Professor Polk is awesome. He presents his lectures clearly and concisely and does everything he can to help his students. Provides exam reviews, sends out Emails before each exam with all the questions he's received that unit and the answers. When you do well, he'll Email you to congratulate you. Great dude. If you do the work, you'll get an A.", 
            "Prof Polk is one of the best proffessors that I have had thus far at Michigan. His lectures are extremely clear and very well thought out. He gives lots of examples and explains everything thoroughly. Polk is obviously interested in his field. Grading is very fair and exams are based on lectures (little book reading) with generally no surprises.", 
            "Thad Polk is such a good man. You can genuinely tell he cares about the students he teaches and I wish I could take another class by him. I thought he was quite a good lecturer and even though the lectures are online make sure you go to class.", 
            "thinking about the best profs i've had and although i took this class a year ago, there is still no one that compares to Dr. Polk. I am so inspired by how much he genuinely cared about his students. Dinner parties, congratulatory emails when you do well on exams, willing to help in any way possible. Also gave an awesome TED talk this year.", 
            "Thad is the best professor I've experienced at UMich. He's fantastically engaging, excited about cog. psych, and you can tell he enjoys teaching. He's the kind of person I want to grow up to be like. Material can be slightly tough, but he presents in such an interesting way that the class as a whole becomes amazing.", 
            "The class itself is boring but Dr. Polk really tries to keep students engaged and interested. The first test is the hardest but other than that it isn't bad. He hosts dinner parties at his house and its really fun to interact with a professor in a new way", 
            "Thad is one of my favorite professors at this University. He really engages in and cares about the material he is teaching. Makes sure his students understand everything he is explaining. Provides study guides, and if you study a decent amount, you'll get an A.", 
            "If you have to take this class, Dr. Polk's lecture is the one to be in! By far the BEST professor I've had so far. I loved his class so much that I considered taking more classes with him.", 
            "I was thoroughly impressed by Dr. Polk after taking Psych 240. He absolutely goes beyond above and beyond for his students (he always seeks to improve the course, invites students to dinner at his house, etc). He's also a clear and engaging lecturer. Highly recommend!", 
            "Thad is a great prof who genuinely cares about his students. I found the material to be very dry, but Thad keeps the lectures interesting and clear. Blue review and sends out lengthy emails to everyone in the class before exams answering students questionsvery helpful! 3 exams, weekly quizzes and 1 paper. Try to get Daniel Porter as your GSI", 
            "Professor Polk did a great job of taking dry material and making it more bare able. Good class. Do not need the book but need to do the readings online for the exams. GSI makes or breaks the class and sections are not very helpful (but need to go for the quizzes)", 
            "Professor Polk actually makes cog psych interesting. Assignments are pretty easy but harshly graded. Weekly quizzes are easy as long as you've attended lecture and somewhat paid attention. Tests are rote memorization, as in any 200 level psych course here. Lectures are blue-reviewed.", 
            "Professor Polk is the most helpful teacher I've had in my 3 years at Michigan. Before every exam he opens up a question-and-answer email chain and literally takes all students' questions and broadcasts them to the whole class. He makes it super easy to learn the material because he just repeats, repeats, repeats key terms. Loved this class.", 
            "Doctor Polk will change your life. Take his class even if you have to fight to the death for a spot.", 
            "There is not a single negative criticism I can say about Dr. Polk. His classes aren't particularly easy, but other than that he is an absolutely fantastic (and incredibly intellectual) professor with a profound interest in the material he teaches. Yet, the best part about Dr. Polk is his genuine understanding of just how students should be taught."

He doesn't use Canvas or post notes online and pop quizzes make attendance mandatory, but his lectures are interesting so they were always worth going to.", 
            "He's a professor who do not use Canvas or any tech things which makes attendance mandatory. Another thing I don't like is he tests on random things from textbook and you won't know what will be tested on from textbook. Textbook questions made up about 20% percent of exam.", 
            "great class, but kind of an odd professor. no canvas page or use of technology whatsoever. the class is easy if you stay on top of the readings and go to lecture for the quizzes (he tells you exactly what will be covered). side note, he emphasized that it was important to use the current textbook edition but I didn't (free pdf) and did well", 
            "Connects all the material we learn in class to real life experiences, work and traditions around the world. He makes the material very easy to recall, and his lectures are always fun to attend.", 
            "Pretty good lecturer, tests don't have any surprises if you do the reading. He will NOT offer make up tests even if you ask in advance, so if you think you'll miss a test, don't sign up. Will get very upset if people skip class, so he has pop quizzes which make attendance mandatory. He also threatens to fail students for using their phones.", 
            "Dr. Chang is a great professor who is very knowledgeable on the topic. Going to class is mandatory as 90% of the material comes from lecture and he does not post his notes. He does give pop quizzes, but they are easy if you have been in class. Very passionate about his work and will help you do well if you put in the effort.", 
            "Ed is an amazing lecturer with tons of clinical and teaching experience. His lectures are old school, but they really help you to pay attention and better understand the material. There are a lot of pop quizzes but they're generally pretty easy as long as you come to class and do the readings By far my favorite class and prof at Michigan.", 
            "I loved this class and Dr. Chang! The lectures are straight forward with basic note taking, and he leaves room for discussion. The exams are easy if you read the assigned chapters. There's an interactive project at the end where you integrate class material in a mock treatment with a client and then present the findings in class. So cool!", 
            "I took several of Dr. Chang's classes many years ago at NKU. He is brilliant and inspirational. I wish he still taught there. I couldn't wait to attend every one of his classes. I left each time feeling inspired, energized, and wanting to learn more. His lectures were interesting and he had a great sense of humor. Miss you Dr. Chang!", 
            "Ed Chang has high expectations of his students. Attendance is completely mandatory, seeing as though there are quizzes nearly every class with no chance to make them up. Overall though, he is an excellent professor. He gives plenty of real work examples, cares that his students understand material, and is passionate about what he teaches.", 
            "Dr. Chang is a good lecturer who told interesting stories about his work experience. There is a big emphasis on the textbook. I sometimes felt like we were not tested on the main concepts, but rather, on random details from both the textbook and lecture. Going to class and reading the textbook are both very important for success in the class.", 
            "Very strict about specific things (phones, participation, etc.), but overall pretty cool professor and easy class if you just pay attention. A lot of people complain about his old-school tactics, but not allowing electronics in class really did help me do better, so I thank him for that.", 
            "One of the coolest guys ever! He ALWAYS has something to say when we're discussing the readings but it's so helpful when he contributes. Strict about showing up to class, but honestly it's worth going to class for. So energetic and awesome!", 
            "Though Dr. Chang has funny anecdotes that make him charming, he's nearly impossible to meet with and he clearly cares more about his research than the design of this class - we never had a course site and we took notes from an overhead projector. Such old-school methods for a young guy, and detrimental to the student experience.", 
            "Dr. Chang was really passionate about teaching and constantly worked in stories from his own life making it more interesting. It's easy to keep up with notes during class, but make sure you're there b/c he doesn't post them. Dont use your phone during lecture, he'll call you out. You definitely need to read for the exams.", 
            "Dr. Chang was a great professor, he cares about his students and made class interesting plus is really funny. Just had to read and study lecture notes/the text to get an A/A-", 
            "Dr. Chang is seriously phenomenal. His lectures are long, but if you're truly interested in the topic it goes by quickly. The notes are clear cut, and he tells you what to study for the exam. Reading is necessary, but again it's really interesting. His exams are very straight forward! He truly cares about the students.", 
            "Lectures are long & require attendance. No notes or slides are posted online. His outlines and lecturing is clear-cut. Just study and read the textbook and you will get an A. He also offers extra credit occasionally, but I wouldn't expect it. Also, in-class pop quizzes are during lecture but he often tells you what they'll be on / when.", 
            "Prof Chang was my favorite professor so far at the university, he tells you exactly what you need to know for tests, and keeps things real in the classroom. He is very easy to listen to and amazing teacher. Super impressive how he facilitates such good discussions in a lecture hall. 11/10 people find him to be amazing.", 
            "Dr. Chang had a lot of interesting personal examples. Lectures were basically copying notes from an overhead projector, which could get a bit tedious. Exams were straightforward, but had a lot of info that wasn't covered in lecture that you had to read in the textbook. Quizzes weren't bad, and there were opportunities for extra credit."

            "Excellent professor. GO TO LECTURES!! Handwriting could use some work. If you have any problems with the material, sit near the front so you can keep track of the lecture. He will answer your questions until you are satisfied you understand, but only if you are there to do so. EECS 280 is not easy, only take it if you are interested in programming.", 
            "Awesome professor. Every day he came to class well prepared, and kept me interested with really interesting material. His style is very engaging, and not at all droll. His projects were relevant and relatively easy. He was very approachable and great with questions. And he always provided a 5 min break to give us all a breather/ clear anything up", 
            "Very clear in his explanation. He really made sure every student is on the same page before he proceeds: he spent one lecture to answer students' questions and re-explain previous materials, when he was supposed to teach iterators. Probably the best professor and most interesting class I had in UMich so far!", 
            "One of the best professors at umich",

            "Noble is totally cool! He's brilliant and funny, and he knows how to make the most difficult and boring material both understandable and interesting. You will not learn just about the syntax of C++, but about how to actually think about programming. Simply amazing!",

He keeps the whole class interested even when talking about really tough concepts. The average on the first test was very low (52%), so I don't know how good he is about preparing exams. In general though, he's an amazing teacher!", 
            "Best professor I've had at UM. If you're not into CS, don't take his class. But if you are, he will teach you everything you've ever wanted to know if you ask. Best lecture notes ever, better than any textbook I've ever seen. Funny in class, always super-prepared, incredibly sharp and intelligent. If you can take this class, and are in EECS, DO IT!", 
            "One of my favorite professors thus far. Very enthusiastic about computer science and very approachable. I definitely recommend taking a class from him. Don't procrastinate on the projects and make sure you know the material for the exams. Very helpful class though, highly recommended.", 
            "Worst Class ive ever taken, spending 40 hours on a project and getting most of it wrong is typical. Exams are impossible.", 
            "Noble is a great guy and a decent teacher, but nearly everything you have to do in the class you must figure out yourself. you are expected to be skilled in C++ before taking it. Exams are really hard, projects are extremely long and painful. Dont take this class unless you have to", 
            "Runs a good class. Well organized and effective communicator. The class moves fast though so keep up! Be prepared to spend around 20 hours on each project. Start early. The exams are deadly! No joke!", 
            "Great prof! But do NOT miss a single lecture or you will be completely lost forever. Projects arent too bad if you start them early and leave yourself about 15-25 hours per project (after P2). Prof is VERY familiar with the class but exams are nasty so make sure you score in the projects. And again, do NOT miss a single one of his lectures.",

Noble is also extremely helpful, personally showing me how to use gdb and emacs. The material was very well orgainized and example code aided with solid understanding. The one topic I still feel shaky about is the lecture I missed!",

Unfortunately, much of the class is spent presenting outlines, so you probably won't come out of this class with a great understanding of Nietzsche's ideas. However, the Prof is brilliant, the reading is interesting, and the papers are graded VERY generously", 
            "Prof Peters is fantastic. He starts the class of by saying that everyone will get a good grade, and while that is true, do NOT think that this is a gut. Presentations from each student are required for almost every class. However, he is very forgiving (when you botch it) and cares very much about students. He looks exactly like Christopher Walken!!",

Unnecessarily difficult and annoying. Also you memorize 600 terms for a 50 question test. Have fun",

            "Lecture slides were pretty boring. He tries to outline his lecture on his slides, but often mis-letters them, and then it gets confusing. GSIs write the assignments and exams. The exams are a lot harder than you'd think. I studied a lot and only got a B on the exams.", 
            "By far the worst professor I have ever had. He does not make up the assignments or write his own exams. His lectures are extremely boring and poorly made. He does not know how to use powerpoint and does not make the material interesting. If you want to sleep through lecture this is the class for you. Very easy but not worth how boring it is.", 
            "OK the lectures are pretty boring but the good news is that if you go to discussion and skim the books, you'll probably get an A. The GSIs make up the exams and grade the papers, but it's generally an easy class. Good for RE credit and SS too!", 
            "Lectures are livable, they are interesting if you are interested in anthropology, and you can afford to miss them if you get the notes from someone. Exams are created by the GSIs, and are decent as long as you study and know the information. Kirsch can be funny if you appreciate a bit of random humor.", 
            "this guy has got to have the easiest lecturing job in the world... the exams are scantrons, the GSI's make the exams, and the GSI's grade the papers. But overall the course is alright... Kirsch likes to talk A LOT about his own anthro studies, but overall the class was a pretty decent one.", 
            "The class will be a pretty easy A, you don't even have to do the reading really, as long as you show up. The class really isn't very interesting at all, sometimes Kirsch has cool stories, but most of the time the material is boring", 
            "This prof is TERRIBLE. Worst lecturer I have had to listen. Very unorganized. Can't seem to formulate what he's trying to say so that his lecutres flow. Very erratic and jumpy lectures. Can you say boring and confusing", 
            "Dr. Kirsch was a great prof. Go to lecture, take notes, and you're going to get an easy A on his two multiple choice exams.", 
            "He is the worst professor I have ever had. His class is boring and his exams are hard. I never heard of anyone curving an anthro class. I took this as a joke and got a C. I know people that took other profs and got easy A's and never went to lecture. If you feel like sleeping for an hour i suggest kirsch.", 
            "One of the most passionate teachers I have met. You can tell that he really cares about his students and his work with the Yonggom. The tests were hard, but at least he challenged us to think.", 
            "Maybe a little boring, but he is funny. Most people don't notice because they are busy sleeping or leaving early. Give him a chance- he actually has a good sense of humor. However, exams are too difficult and the discussions are useless except to get credit for the quizes"

His in-class examples are much easier than the test questions, and he doesn't really go over the \"Why?\" on each problem like the other professors for 215. Material isn't awful, but the tests are tough", 
            "Don't take 215 with Ruan. He has a pretty thick accent, but I was still able to understand it and I was still lost for most of the semester. I learned more from the textbook and countless YouTube videos instead of him. He's funny and tells jokes here and there, but it doesn't make up for his teaching style (or lack there of).", 
            "He teaches us the bare minimum in lecture. On written homeworks, no one knows how to answer any of the questions; he simply doesn't teach us anything that relates to or shows up on these assignments or the exams. He doesn't even curve until the end of the semester so good luck trying to figure out how you're doing in the class. Do not take him.",

He's accent can be pretty difficult to understand at times but after a week or so you pick up on it. He understands his accent is an issue and works really hard to be extremely helpful in office hours. I would highly recommend him.", 
            "Extremely difficult class for me (maybe because the rest of the class was too good and the curve sucked). He was helpful during office hours for the most part, but was very difficult to follow (partly because of accent) during lecture", 
            "His lecture style is to use examples but his accent and handwriting can be difficult to understand. He knows his accent is bad so if you go to office hours he will do his best to help you. Overall, he wants his students to come to office hours if they have issues and is more than willing to help", 
            "Professor Ruan is a really nice guy. His accent is really hard to understand at times, which I can forgive, but his handwriting is awful. His lecture style is to use examples. I relied very heavily on the textbook to learn the material. If you don't use a textbook, choose another professor. Otherwise, Ruan is okay. Just come to class prepared.",

            "1st month of class: I absolutely hated the teacher, he taught poorly, I could't understand him, and I wasn't learning from. Post first midterm, I started understanding him and he really started doing a good job. I attended other lecturers' classes and he was def better. Although, I did go to his office hours and he treated me like an idiot.",

            "I ended up doing fine in the class, but I didn't feel like I was learning anything in lecture. His style is mostly to teach with examples and very little words/explanations. His English is mostly understandable, but not the best."

Not only were his lectures the best way to start my day, but he ensured that everyone in the course understood the material, and if you didn't, he would take the time to ensure that you do (given you take advantage of office hours).

Yuri also made an effort to squeeze in extra office hours when needed, and took time to explain concepts and problem in office hours.

Really sympathetic too, which is helpful considering he assigns a lot of reading. His humor is a bit eccentric and provocative, but you get used to it.",

            "Louis is an awesome, clear lecturer. I loved this class. Some very complex topics are covered, and thanks to his fantastic grasp of the content he could break them down into understandable presentations. His lectures are energetic and engaging. Definitely one of the better lecturers here at UM.", 
            "The only professor I've ever had who got a standing ovation after his last lecture of the semester. He's the best lecturer I've ever had, honestly. For discussion, I had a different GSI who was just okay. The tests and essays are graded entirely by your GSIs. As long as you're able to think really critically, you'll do fine.", 
            "He does like philosophy but I would not recommend taking a class of his if you haven't taken other college philosophy classes. I had to work crazy hard to get a C+, where I got A's in all my other classes. I also had him as my discussion leader which I highly recommend no one does. He doesn't really explain or add much, it't mainly student lead", 
            "The lectures are necessary only in that everything he writes on the board is helpful. If you have a friend who goes, you dont need to.I had Loeb as my discussion leader as well-it was a disaster. Highly recommend that you get a different gsi. It would've been helpful to hear things from a different perspective. Loeb goes off on tangents like crazy.", 
            "EASY CLASS! If you attend every lecture, it is an easy A. Discussions are no help at all to the class. Also, DON'T BUY THE BOOK! It is unnecessary and the tests are based on lectures, not the book.", 
            "Good lecturer - tries to keep things interesting, and acknowledges when things will get boring. Overall, seems nice and not too harsh, but in large classes, you just have to do what is told of you and you'll be fine. Jeremy Lent was my GSI and he was amazing.", 
            "I'm a senior now and I took 232 two years ago with Loeb. I didn't care about philosophy and now I'm a major. My GSI was Anna Edmonds, probably the smartest best GSI in the whole school. Loeb and Edmonds made me fall in love with the subject, absolutely great course.", 
            "awesome professor, take his class", 
            "Engaging", 
            "I started out using the text book, but when I realized it was not helping me I stopped. Loeb explains things very clearly, so take a lot of notes in his lectures and you should be all set for the exams. Definitely not an \"easy A\", however. If that is what you are looking for, find another class.", 
            "Loeb was AWESOME!!! I would definitely take his class again if only I could fit it in my schedule. He was very entertaining during class and was very passionate about the subject. He really wanted us to learn.", 
            "Easily my favorite professor this semester. He is easy to follow, explains new and difficult concepts well and has a sense of humor. For phil 232 there were 2 exams, 2 essays and an options to either write a third paper to raise your grade or revise one of the original two. I had an interest in philosophy and this class has eased me into it.", 
            "This guy is very fun. Good classes with him", 
            "Louis is so fun to listen to. He is so passionate that you can't help being interested sometimes the theories get a little confusing, this is philosophy, but as long as you as questions in disscussion you're fine. The reading isn't really that helpful, but it is interesting (the articles are the original theories).", 
            "This guy is pretty good prof, but he is hard to understand. It really all just depends on your GSI for Problems of Philosophy, to be honest. David Plunket was the man. The class is pretty tough, especially for an intro. It isn't too hard as long as you do most of the readings and attend every discussion. Don't miss discussion. You can miss lecture.", 
            "Loeb is awesome! He is charasmatic and loves to teach. He will make time to meet with his students when they are persistent. I also had him for section, but I think he is a much better lecturer than section leader.", 
            "Loeb loves philosophy which make the lectures mildly entertaining. Some material is interesting, others quite boring. Papers are straight-forward and don't require alot of deep thinking. Exams reflect the notes. No need to read, just take notes and you're fine.", 
            "Loeb is definately a character. He's a great lecturer who keeps you entertained and is a funny guy. The stories he tells are hilarious! If you do all the reading, you'll do well on his exams.", 
            "I liked him, he was interesting", 
            "Prof. Loeb is awesome! From the gigantic yellow chalk stains that he gets on his shirt and hands to the occational fist bangs on the table (when he gets a little too into in the material) - this guy is fun to watch! His class is like watching a Southern priest give a passionate sermon - very intense and interesting! I recommend taking him!!"

            "Pernick is so knowledgeable. There are a few papers and a long research paper toward the end of the semester, but there is a lot of freedom to research what you want and decide what path the paper will take. Pernick is a great resource who meets with you multiple times throughout the semester to give feedback and guidance.", 
            "Pernick is passionate about what he teaches. He knows so much about what he teaches and he is an excellent resource for papers. I've never heard anyone say a bad word about him. His lectures are long, but they have a lot of information, his discussion lead classes are great. A lot of reading per week but it's usually not boring. I've had him twice.", 
            "Professor Pernick is quite possibly the best professor I've had in my four years here. He is incredibly passionate about health history, but more importantly, he's incredibly passionate about teaching. He cares about every one of his students, will do whatever he can to help you succeed in the class, and goes out of his way to meet with students.", 
            "The difference between Pernick and a lot of other professors is he doesn't just care about the history of medicine, he cares about teaching it, and he REALLY cares about his students. His quizzes are straightforward and not in any way designed to trick you. Although they're long, he makes his lectures really interesting. He doesn't expect you to read every word of the readings, just to skim them. He will meet with you for extra credit on quizzes and provide you with the books if you can't afford them. Definitely recommend if you need the credit, especially if you're pre-health.", 
            "Martin is a great guy. He is so extremely passionate about the topic. BUT the class is semi-difficult. He is a tough grader on exams.", 
            "Pernick is an inspirational expert on this subject. The midterm and final are blue book essays and there were five quizzes in class throughout the semester. Lectures relate and bring life to the weekly readings (still need to do them) and discussion was helpful. Take the class because you like history or if you just want to be an informed citizen.", 
            "Professor Pernick was a great professor. He was pretty monotone, but he managed to hold my attention during lecture because the material was so interesting. There's a lot of assigned reading, but he talks about almost all of it in lecture so it's not necessarily required. If you take good notes, this class is manageable. I definitely recommend it.", 
            "Professor Pernick was the best professor I've had at Michigan. Lectures are told in narrative style, which makes them interesting and also makes it easier to remember information for the exams. He cares for his students and it really shows. Overall, a thought-provoking class with an inspiring professor.", 
            "Professor Pernick was the best professor I have had as of yet. He was so organized and well read and his method of teaching was so efficient. I would recommend Professor Pernick to all interested students and would love to take this course over and over again!!", 
            "Section is a joke and kind of arbitrary discussion grade. HUGE amount of reading. He tries to be helpful if you need notes or whatever, talks real slow so I nodded off a couple times. Learned so much from this class, but it's definitely a lot of work.", 
            "I loved Pernick. I originally took his 284 course and loved it so much that I decided to take his new course to finish off my social science requirements. There is a lot of reading but it is a history class. Pernick is extremely helpful and nice and you will learn a tremendous amount about the history of disease. My favorite class to date.", 
            "Professor Pernick is a very good teacher who clearly knows and enjoys his subject. His grading and assignments are challenging but fair, and he takes plenty of time to go over them. His exams are kind of annoying for their length, but he's fairly generous with grading. Sometimes, he'll refer to himself in the third person, which is a little awkward", 
            "Amazing professor, very clear, very willing to help students out. Extremely fair grader. Really knows what he's talking about. If you pay attention in lectures and take good notes, you will do well.", 
            "Professor Pernick is a wonderful professor! He is incredibly knowledgeable, perceptive and insightful. His seminar did require a lot of reading, but as long as you understand the main idea of the articles and books and could participate in class, skim reading was sufficient. I would definitely recommend his seminar! It was really interesting!", 
            "Prof Pernick is a great guy who really cares about the material he teaches. Class is pretty easy and you actually get kind of into it after a while. Definitely recommended.", 
            "greatest professor i've had in four years. engaging, challenging, insightful. lectures are fun and interesting. he brings in multimedia and discusses a variety of historical perspectives. fair amount of reading, but honestly, welcome to college. overall, great class.", 
            "Pr. Pernick is great! Most lectures are pretty interesting though sometimes he goes a bit fast. Only downside is that notes are not posted online. Great class in general, taught well and really gives you new insight about medicine and science.", 
            "Extremely fair grader. He loves teaching but can get really boring at times. As long as you skim the readings and pay attention to his key points you will do well.", 
            "it is so great to find a prof who actually loves teaching! my favorite class", 
            "Kind of an interesting class, though it got dry at times. Not very much work at all. I didn't do any of the reading after the midterm and I still got an A. Pretty easy I would say."

            "I really wish I could like Proulx. He can be funny and clearly knows the material, but he's no good at actually teaching it. I do all the work and reading (mandatory and otherwise) for this class and it's clear that he needlessly overcomplicates ideas -- he'll show a useless proof of why something works, but never actually show how to do it.", 
            "I feel like Proulx's not as bad as his RMP score reflects. The class is difficult for sure, but Proulx is a great lecturer and very helpful in his office hours. He tries his hardest to teach you the concepts and will spend as much time as needed.", 
            "Proulx obfuscates concepts with unnecessary amounts of esoteric technical language and has a general attitude of \"this is how it is because I said so.\" He offers little explanation of concepts yet designs exams to leave students confused and unsure about the majority of questions.", 
            "Proulx's RMP score is way more indicative of the toughness of his classes, rather than his actual quality as a professor. He's a great guy and you'll do great in the class if you do the readings, homeworks, and workbooks. Slack off and you will fall behind very fast. The class is hard, but Proulx's lectures are engaging & he's always ready to help", 
            "Very tough class. Be sure to do the assigned reading BEFORE the lecture and take good notes. Proulx gets a rap for being bad but really how well you do is entirely dependent on how much you put into it. If you understand basic Calc I you can get away with not completely understanding the concepts. Study a lot for tests.", 
            "Proulx is funny, endearingly quirky, and for the most part able to convey the material effectively. The tests are pretty straightforward and virtually every question feels ripped from the quizzes in the back of the workbook. You should still expect to put in the effort in learning the material, though, because there's a lot of it and it moves fast.", 
            "Class based entirely on math (Calc 1 / partial derivatives). Put in the work (a LOT of work) and you'll be fine- if you at least can answer the exam questions that are straight off the workbook problems, you'll get close to the class median (which was about a 60-70%). Proulx is a good lecturer and slides are super helpful.", 
            "Your grade in this class is basically weighed entirely by exams, which are impossible. Exam averages were in the 50th percentile. Lecture slides were overcomplicated and exams were full of complex test questions that were impossible to understand. This class is used to weed out students from the econ major because it is that difficult.", 
            "I stopped going to lecture after the fourth one because he's quite dry. However, I thoroughly went over his notes (for conceptual information) and spent A LOT OF TIME doing the workbook. YOU NEED TO WORK FOR THIS; HALF OF MY STUDYING WAS SPENT ON THIS CLASS. You can do well relying on being good at math and not concepts. Not the opposite though.", 
            "Proulx isn't that bad. His lecture slides hand you everything you need to know. I think he's a decent lecturer. Doing well in 401 requires a ton of work: do the workbook (at least the assigned problems), homework, quizzes in the workbook, and practice questions provided. Don't get behind on material and you'll be fine.", 
            "Exams determined way too much of the class grade. Homework questions were hilariously difficult and worth so little points. If you're great at math you'll be able to figure it out, however with calc 2 background I had a tough time following lectures and the slides were basically statements without explanation and very badly formatted.", 
            "Econ 401 is a weeder course (not easy), relying on math/quantitative ability rather than intuition. That being said, Professor Proulx covers a lot in each lecture, and pointlessly derives some formulas or gives you the long method when it can be done quicker and easier. It's do-able, if you put the work in. Dr. Proulx is quirky and is pretty dry.", 
            "His class was very very dry and it was impossible to follow along with the material. While 401 is on it's own a difficult class, Prolux did not help make it more engaging.", 
            "Proulx really dives into the concepts and aims to provide a DEEP understanding of each and every chapter. That being said, each chapter is packed to the brim with information and requires a very strong calculus understanding. The tests are very hard, and you will be doing a LOT of work if you want to score at least an average \"C\" on tests.", 
            "Proulx gets a terrible undeserved rep. He is an amazing lecturer and clearly explains all the concepts. The class is extremely math heavy and knowledge of calc 3 is very useful. It seems that many studetns have problems with the math portion of the class because the economics is not very difficult. Easy if you're good at math, difficult if not.", 
            "If you are really interested in Economics and want to go beyond exam and grades, it is a solid choice. Proulx gives a lot of deep knowledge behind the general concept, which is useful for getting a deep understanding in Economics. But if you just want to get an A and are not very good at math, be careful.", 
            "Proulx was not all bad. I went to most of his office hours and put in good time before the exams to prepare and I did fine. Its an extremely tough class, but it is definitely doable if you put in the time. He is definitely a weird dude, but also a nice guy and i actually really enjoyed this class.", 
            "As an individual, Proulx is NOT approachable, and he is often condescending to his students. That said, he is an excellent lecturer. ECON 401 is a very difficult class, but doable if you put in the work. Workbook problems and homeworks are very helpful, lectures less so, and the textbook less so. Be ahead in the class, falling behind is very rough.", 
            "His lecture slides are so confusing and helpless, and his workbook contains too many long questions which I do not want to work out.", 
            "Proulx was one of the worst professors I've had for econ. His lectures are extremely helpful. I tried my best to take diligent notes and follow along, but when I came back to them I had no idea what we were learning. The best thing you can do is all of the PS's and HW assignments and workbook. It was the only way I could do well in the class"

            "Good professor, though he sometimes assumes the students understand things that they obviously don't. It's a tough class regardless of which professor you get. I'd say take it with Gus if you get the chance", 
            "He is an awful professor. He wastes class literally 3/4 of his class time with demos and student presentations which he should be spending trying to prepare his class for the exams that are too long and difficult to finish in an hour. Has difficulty following his own notes when in the time he does spend lecturing. Would not recommend this class.", 
            "Evrard is very hard and I wouldn't advise for anyone to take his course. He is very into theory and likes long boring derivations on the board. The tests are very hard and rely a lot on material only taught in class. He often states the textbook is too easy.", 
            "Gus is a pretty cool dude. He knows his stuff, but doesn't always explain things that clearly. Homework is very doable but tests are hard. Take advantage of his office hours.", 
            "Cool sense of humor. Classes were fun", 
            "The lectures are good for demonstrations and not a whole lot else. Unfortunately, the Qwizdom policy makes it pseudo-mandatory. The discussion section is definitely the best place to practice and ask questions. The exams aren't all that difficult.", 
            "The guy is hot, no doubt, but uses lecture time to show statistics and do cool demos instead of explaining concepts. To get an A in his class, you will need to use ALL available resources: Discussion section professor (if you have a good one), the textbook, the student solutions manual, study groups, and most importantly the Help Room.", 
            "Great Teacher, Very Enthusiastic, Very Helpful. Lectures are mandatory but useful for understanding. Nice guy, really wants you to understand the material and succeed. Exams are brutally hard, self-admittedly. Do the problems in the book and pray for a B...", 
            "Overall this is a fun class and an interesting teacher. The demos are especially good. However, the thing that gets me is that the exams are unfairly hard, even to the point that the GSIs have trouble deciphering some of the problems. Be wary of that.", 
            "Good instructor, overall. Well paced lectures which covered the major topics of the reading (but you still need to read the book). Not a bad experience for a huge intro lecture course. Gus included some interesting demonstrations and quips about cycling. Tests were tough; homeworks were canned problems from textbook publisher."

            "I absolutely loved Dr. Gehring and his genuine care for each and every student. The interesting material covered in lecture was underscored by his passion for the subject. Exams are fair if you pay attention in lecture and review the study guide. I highly recommend 240 but take any class you can with Dr. Gehring, you won't regret it.",

            "Professor Gehring is awesome. I'm in Education so this class was really relevant to me, although I felt out of my element at times. His work ethic is impressive. He really seems to enjoy teaching, which is fantastic. Take good notes, study frequently and you'll be fine!", 
            "Gehring is an awesome professor and he makes the subject very interesting without convoluting it too much with details. His assignments/tests are tough, but fairly test your knowledge (even on multiple choice exams). Studying the RIGHT way is hard, but key to doing well. I recommend flashcards.",

There are no papers, your weekly workload is light, and the class is interesting and informative. If you want to do well on his exams, just make sure you understand all the concepts on his review sheets. If it's not on the sheet, then forget about it.",

Really cares about cognitive psych, and is always excited. Plays fun music, funny videos halfway through class, and in-class demos",

He is passionate about the topics but his lectures are boring, dry, and monotone. Assignments are hard to understand and convoluted. Do not take this class.",

I believe he loves what he is teaching but the setup of the class is terrible, lectures were beyond boring, no technology allowed in class (I like using computer for notes) and tests were nothing like the lectures. Got As on essays and failed the midterm.",

            "WORST TEACHER EVER. Lectures and material covered are so boring. I am going into clinical psychology and this man honestly made me doubt my decision because he is so unbearable. Wait to take the class with a different professor.", 
            "His big thing is construct validity. And at the end of the semester I'm still not sure I understand what that is. Going to lecture is a good idea, and definitely go to discussion. He does take suggestions from the class on how to make lecture better. Don't let this class make you change your mind on clinical psychology!", 
            "Absolutely TERRIBLE class. Do not take his lectures. I have been dissuaded from pursuing a clinical psychology career because this man has made this material so boring.", 
            "Worst teacher ever!!! Lectures are worthless...doesn't teach anything and class is solely based on research methods of the diseases...TERRIBLE...and did I mention BORING!!!!!", 
            "Absolutely horrible. Lectures are unbearable, I find it amazing how someone could make such interesting material so awful.", 
            "Material was really interesting for me, and you can tell that he tried to make lecture interesting but he's just not quite there yet. He made his point, but I felt that I got more clarity from my discussion sections. Helpful to go to lecture too though.", 
            "Eats Jimmy Johns every day and, as a Native American found it necessary to relate everything back to studies having to do with Native Americans, even though it had absolutely nothing to do with the class which was quite useful come exam time...", 
            "Easy class. He tried really hard to prepare students for exams and if you study the methods he recommends you'll do just fine. His lectures are pretty monotonous though and he struggles to relate to his audience. Not the greatest lecturer but the material is great.", 
            "kind of hard to understand what he says and he basically just reads the slides, but his tests were easy if you read and study, super interesting topic", 
            "His lectures were very uninteresting because he mainly reads off the slides. However, I only went to lecture every other week and received an A in the class, so it is not very difficult as long as you attend section and read the book. The exams were also pretty easy because he tells you the format ahead of time and what will be covered on the exam.", 
            "Gone's lectures were very structured and followed the powerpoints very tightly. He could be boring sometimes, yes, but the effort and enthusiasm were clearly there and you know he's trying. A main complaint would be that he let the lectures get a bit unruly--lots of early exiters and chattering which was distracting and he should've cracked down.", 
            "More interested in philosophy of abnormal psych...youl hear the phrase construct validity alot but obviously cares about the students and tries hard to explain all the material clearly....usually has interesting case studies and videos."

            "You need to practice a lot in this course. Homework is difficult but test is easier. It's really great because you can understand the concept deeply by those practice. It's interesting and I can feel that Prof devotes a lot into this course.", 
            "Great professor to take this class with. Sandeep makes the class easier because he is easier on the grading. If you had the right approach, and you just made some math error, you can still get full points on the exam question. He really cares that you focus on learning rather than the grade. I think he might be more generous when assigning grades.", 
            "Sandeep is clearly passionate about probability and looks to spread that to his students. He focuses more on the learning rather than the grade. The curves in this class are generous, and the workload isn't too high. Highly recommend 301 with this prof, you will leave with a better appreciation of probability.", 
            "Very helpful professor and a super nice guy. He's clearly an expert in his field. He's a very fair grader and wants to see students succeed. Just do the work and you should be ok. He's definitely the best professor to take this class with.", 
            "Great class when taught by Sandeep. You constantly hear horror stories about EECS 501, but I believe he makes it not as difficult as other professors might make it. It is obvious that he really wants you to focus more on the learning rather than the grade. Workload is like an undergrad class. Exams are very fair, and he is a fairly generous grader.", 
            "I think 501 was more manageable with him than it would be with other professors. The topic is hard no matter who is teaching it, but he made me enjoy it and I would be willing to put in the work. Overall, I had a great experience and would highly recommend taking a course with Sandeep.", 
            "Mr Sandeep made this house easy for me as a new graduate student at the U of M. I thought I might not be able to understand this course, but with his guidance and homework and the amazing GSI he had this course was great.", 
            "Awesome Professor", 
            "For some reason this class is too easy in the sense that he omits many materials. But he covers the basic materials pretty well which are the most important ones. So if you really want to learn something take 501 with him! I totally regret just getting an A+ without really trying to understand and fall in love with probability!", 
            "EECS 301 with Sandeep was one of the fairest EECS courses I have taken. Workload was very fair for a 4 credit class. Exams weren't necessarily easy, but the difficulty was appropriate. Grading was generous that if you make some math mistakes but have the right approach you can still get full credit. He usually teaches 301 in the winter term.", 
            "Sandeep makes the course EASIER, but probability is never easy. Class was curved quite nicely this semester, even though this semester's exam averages were unreasonably high. Sandeep wants students to focus on learning and not just obsess over grades. In my experience, this class is set up so that your grade very fairly reflects your work.", 
            "Sandeep wanted us to learn and enjoy probability rather than stress out about the grade. After having really high exam averages, he agreed to curve based on the historical average rather than our average. Exams and the weekly workload were all very reasonable. The grade distribution was quite generous this term.", 
            "Sandeep is the man. Most EE's don't look forward to probability, but Sandeep makes it a bit easier than other professors. After renumbering the course to get the grad students out, it became a bit easier. Use office hours to get the homework done. Exams aren't terrible and Sandeep is a liberal grader, but a few questions will try to stump you.", 
            "Grading likely won't get more generous for an EECS class than with Sandeep. Probability takes hard work to learn, but Sandeep made great use of examples and writes reasonably difficult exams (you get 3 cheat sheets for the final). He makes funny jokes in lecture to liven things up. Glad a major EE roadblock was not so daunting with him.", 
            "If you work hard, there is no excuse to get less than a B+ in the class. Exam averages were high this semester, so Sandeep was more generous with grades. You can get full credit by showing that you understand the setup of the problem without being fully mathematically correct. People who do bad on exams are usually the ones who don't come to class.", 
            "All EECS professors need to be like Sandeep. Probability is not easy and the class was manageable because of him. The amount of time you are expected to put into this class is VERY fair. Exams are not terribly difficult, although the true false questions may cause many people to second guess themselves. I would take any course that Sandeep teaches.", 
            "If you are an EE and have to take this for your probability requirement, Sandeep makes this more manageable than other professors. He grades based on your understanding regardless of how your classmates do, so if the averages are quite high, you can still get a high grade if you only did about average. Encourages questions in lecture.", 
            "EECS 301 does not get any easier than this with any other professor (although no EECS class is easy). Homework isn't bad if you go to class and discussion. If you get an exam question wrong you can still get full credit by having the right approach. I wish all EECS classes treated you this way. If Sandeep were to teach 455 I would love to take it.", 
            "Write down all of the examples done in class and in discussion, as they are very helpful for the homework. Exam are representative of the homework and practice problems. Be warned that watching somebody solve probability problems will make it seem easy, but you need to actually practice problem solving on your own to learn the material.", 
            "This is probably the easiest this class has gotten in quite a few years. The class averages on exams were surprisingly high and a 75 was the lower bound of a B+. You don't need the book, however there are no electronic lecture notes so you have to go to class and take notes to get the information you need. Go to office hours to do the homework."

            "Compton is one of the best lecturers I've ever had. The class itself is definitely not the greatest, but Compton's lectures made it so much better. His explanations of complicated topics are very clear, and he tells tons of stories about the history of CS, which makes lectures interesting. I wouldn't hesitate to take a class with him again!", 
            "Very nice guy who is accessible outside of class and is willing to answer questions. No lecture slides used and only some lecture notes posted online. The class itself sucks and was made even more difficult by the useless GSIs. Highly recommend that you don't take the class unless you have to. If you do have to take it, Compton is a solid choice.", 
            "Dropped the class after two weeks because lectures did not match up with the material being assigned for homework. The homework is a huge chunk of your grade and supposedly the exam. You basically have to memorize the answer, and nothing more. Even the GSIs were confused at that time, which is why i dropped.", 
            "EECS574 with Compton was the best math/theory classes I've taken at UMich. I looked forward to lecture every Monday and Wednesday.", 
            "He's a good professor but his lectures are very confusing. He writes on the white board so the only way to study the stuff you didnt understand is to read the book.", 
            "Professor Compton is by far one of the best professors in the EECS department. Classes were engaging and interesting and we are talking here about lots of abstract math. Homeworks were reasonable, they forced you to think more than pull allnighters. All in all one of the best classes I have taken.", 
            "He is the best professor in the EECS department, take a class with him if you can you won't regret it.", 
            "Compton makes an effort to make the class interesting, and I liked his storytelling style of teaching. However, I felt that I didn't learn too much from the class. The exams were not challenging, and the project took about three hours from start to finish (and that includes debugging).", 
            "Compton is an amazing professor. I didn't have much interest in the class before I took it, and I went to a different professor for a few weeks and hated the class. Then I switched to Compton's 9am (bleh) lecture, and it totally saved the class. He tells funny stories, is super smart, and keeps it interesting!", 
            "Compton is flipping adorable and means well. Still, I think he's just too smart to effectively articulate these concepts. The course as a whole was rather disorganized and you are left to navigate everything on your own. Everything works out fine though because the curve is generous. PROTIP: free bagels every Tuesday in the dude connector at 9:00", 
            "Exams are easier than previous terms, and most of the exam questions are repetition of posted practice problems, so I really think it is easy although it does require a lot of thinking compared to 280 which is essentially nothing but a lot of memorization and work (time-consuming projects). So if you are smart and love math, 203 will be a breeze.", 
            "Disclaimer: This class was much more difficult than EECS 280 for me. I hated the class, and despite all the praise Compton gets, didn't feel he made it much better.", 
            "Pr. Compton's experience in computer science is broad and deep. He has little tips and tricks that aren't taught by other professors or in the book but are extremely useful. He also has great stories about the history of computer science.", 
            "I am not smart but by going to his lectures and paying attention, I miss only 3 points on first two midterms. His 9 am lectures really brings sunshine into my Tuesday and Thursday life. Leaving his lectures my heart is always filled with peace and joy! What a wonderful professor!", 
            "Old-school to the extent that in lecture he said he does not like i-clickers or even computers -- \"Maybe I am in the wrong department,\" which is exactly what makes him amazing! Uses whiteboard so we actually pay attention all the time; humorous so that I now really fall in love with proofs, sets, functions, relations, etc.", 
            "The best of the three instructors in W15. Experienced and humorous. Exams are easier compared with last semester. However, you still need to pay attention and work hard in order to do well in exams. Start to love the topics!",

            "Everyone should take this class with Compton. My advice: go to every lecture, write down every single thing he says, and everything he draws on the board. I still look back on my 203 notebook all the time. It's more useful and concise than most textbooks."

The class revolted at the end, frustrated by having their time wasted. Very lazy teacher. Give multiple choice tests so a machine can grade them. Sad. Avoid at all costs.", 
            "I love Esther! This was my absolute favorite class. Lecture was interesting, she tries to keep the class engaged, and her 2 exams were super straightforward. Be on time, print out her notes, you should be fine. The readings were actually very interesting and manageable. Keep up with them, show up, and review her lectures. She's fantastic and funny.", 
            "I love Esther! Her course is really straightforward. One paper and two exams (both multiple choice). GSI are hit or miss. But if you go to lecture, and get the gist of the readings, you're guaranteed at least a sold B+/A-. Also offers extra credit that raises your grade up 1/3. Great class if you are interested in sexuality or sociology!", 
            "This was the most interesting class I've taken so far. Esther is very knowledgeable and her lectures challenged me to think about sexuality in a new way. The readings were usually long but interesting. I enjoyed reading them. The paper is short, and it's open-ended so it doesn't have to be boring if you don't want it to be. Really awesome class.", 
            "Class is very interesting, the content will keep you awake. Newton, however, is very childish. She will scold anyone who gets up to leave or comes in late mid-sentence in front of the entire class. GSI Tianna is kind of rude. The readings and discussions are good. The paper is pretty boring.", 
            "Grading is easy, but class is torture. She reads directly from slides, and if someone gets up to leave early, she completely stops class and stares them down. Completely childish tactics hugely detracted from class, and diminished most students' respect for her. GSI was completely incompetent - didn't have a concentration in or knowledge of field",

Newton knows her stuff and doesn't take anything from anyone. She IS a feminist and whats wrong with that? I thought she was a character and the class was very interesting",

Her policies are very useless one of her GSI always come's in late one time the GSI came in late with Mc donalds but regualr student's cannot come in late wow now thats rude. Also her GSI are very disrecpectful. So i advis you not to take the class",

            "Professor Newton is, above and beyond, the most brilliant professor I have had at the university. True, she may be a bit cold, but she is absolutely outstanding and hallarious. She has been around a long time and holds more knowledge than any person I have ever met. I suggest you learn to love her and take advantage of such a great opportunity.",

She turns her lecture into the complete opposite as she is always scolding students for numerous reasons. Lectures are not helpful as she always says \"refer to the readings\" even if you do not understand either. AVOID.", 
            "I went into this class very excited about the content. The class itself is very interesting and PJ knows the material well. Unfortunately, this does not make up for the constantly condescending and overall extremely negative atmosphere she created. She claims students are disrespectful but in reality, she (and my GSI) treated students horribly.", 
            "one of the rudest profs I have ever had. I will avoid her the rest of college. she is condescending and polices her classroom to the point where she'll interrupt lecture just to yell at individual students or the class. she sucks at teaching the material. her handwriting is unreadable. dont listen to anyone good responses she's the worst avoid!!!", 
            "I have never felt more disrespected and talked down to. I feel uncomfortable in lecture, as she is EXTREMELY condescending, assuming the absolute worst from us. She thinks she's better than everyone else (too good to use technology). this class is just memorizing and using concepts, no room for creative thought or personal opinion.", 
            "PJ is a great lecturer, very engaging and has a good sense of humor. That being said, if you're looking for an easy A class, or even as easy B this isn't for you. I'm a sociology major, and this is one of the more difficult classes I've taken in the field. The class is super interesting but a lot of the concepts and vocabulary are very nit-picky.", 
            "I've taken a couple classes with her- great lectures which you should attend, because all of her notes were on the chalk board rather than accessibly ppts. and they end up having things that come up on the exams; grades are just on the papers and exams, which are pretty tough which is why exams and being present is so important", 
            "I really enjoyed this class. PJ is really nice and cares about students doing well. Be sure to go to lecture and always read and take summaries of the readings. Be sure to do well and study because your final grade is decided only by 4 assignments. Overall, an enjoyable class", 
            "This is a very interesting class. PJ clearly knows her stuff, but most lecture material comes straight out of the book. She does give good examples to make you understand better. She does not use or post lecture slides on canvas, so make sure you show up to class and take good notes! 2 exams & 2 papers; not hard if you really know the material.", 
            "Great class content, but she's disorganized. Often comes to class missing some of her notes, though her lectures tend to be better without them. She absolutely knows her stuff, and you'll leave with a new lens on the world. Would highly recommend taking Criminology for the class, but don't expect her to be warm and cuddly - though she loves dogs!", 
            "Hands down the single best professor I've had in my entirety at the University of Michigan. Definitely a professor for those who like to learn rather than just be able to regurgitate information. Even though attendance isn't required, I always wanted to attend because of how good at lecturing PJ is, plus the jokes!", 
            "I really enjoyed taking SOC465 with PJ. She's witty, funny, but also quite serious about her work. The lectures might not work for everyone, but I appreciated how she wrote the main points on the board along with diagrams. She has a large vocabulary and sometimes the lecture concepts were hard, but my GSI was great with clarification.", 
            "PJ is a very interesting professor. Her lecture style is different because she solely uses a chalk board, but I found it to be very unique and useful. With this in mind, going to lectures is pretty much mandatory because the only way you will be able to get the lecture notes is if you take them yourself or have someone take a pic of the board", 
            "I took PJ's class 2 years ago, and now am in a phD criminal justice program and find that her class had significant, lasting impact on me. Exceptionally valuable in the long term, if you take the material seriously. 2 years later I can construct a lesson plan on new material based on PJ's idea maps about interest politics. I'm doing it right now.", 
            "I love PJ. The GSI was wonderful, her class was very informative, and I feel like I am a much smarter person after absorbing her knowledge. I would recommend this course to anyone who is bored of their other soc/women's studies/psych classes learning the same thing over and over again. PJ's course is challenging, but that's what makes you grow.", 
            "PJ is overrated. This had to be 1 of the hardest classes I've taken at Michigan. It was so boring and very hard to stay focused because she spends half of lecture nagging about us not doing readings and electronics. The chalkboard is so annoying because if you did not write everything down then you are screwed. she's a good person but not professor", 
            "Really great professor. However, she has a no cell phone and no laptop policy. I know that bothers a lot of students (and it bothered me too) but it paid off immensely. I took another one of her classes at the same time (Sociology of Sexuality) and it was equally wonderful! She is hilarious and incredibly intelligent.", 
            "PJ is amazing. 10/10 would take again. Sociology of Sex is super interesting, but watch out to keep up with the readings. The papers involved a lot of synthesis in an analysis of media, which was cool. Pay attention and take notes in lecture and you'll be fine (but don't use your phone! She'll shame you!).", 
            "Possibly the worst class I've taken at UMich. My GSI was awful, and assigned a five page essay to be due the day after the final paper was due for the class. The lectures are long, and she never puts the information online. There's at least 2 academic journal articles due each lecture, and they are not interesting. Hype over PJ is unwarranted.", 
            "I've heard that PJ's classes are amazing, but I really have to disagree. Lectures are long and tedious, and her teaching style does not help you retain information. Exam prep is not helpful, and essays are graded harshly. My GSI was not the best either. The hype around this class is very unwarranted, in my opinion.", 
            "I was told PJ was one of the best professors in Sociology at Michigan, but her lectures dragged on and on and on. She was interesting for about 20 minutes but her use of the chalkboard takes up unnecessary time and makes students lose interest. She is a very harsh grader and it seems to get a good grade you cannot think outside of the box."

            "His passion for astronomy and teaching is contagious. He always desires to provide the students with the best chances to learn, and the lectures in his half of the semester were engaging. Definitely recommended to anyone!", 
            "Astro101 with Prof. Bell is great. I have never met someone so passionate about what they are teaching. You can see that he truly loves astronomy and teaching it to other people. The class is fun and not that difficult. The group project at the end takes a little bit of work, but as long as you pick a good group you should be fine.", 
            "Bell loves astronomy so much and that is evident in his lectures where he is always super enthusiastic. 2-3 homework assignments per week that aren't hard, two exams, and attendance points. Definitely would take again, Bell is always willing to help students, and he is very thorough and good at explaining.", 
            "This guy is phenomenal.", 
            "Eric Bell is an exceptional professor. He lives for Astronomy and that comes out in his outstanding lectures. His expectations were reasonable and his instructions were always very clear. If you are wary of natural science courses for their math component, take this class with this man.", 
            "Pretty clear class. i got a D on the first test so it was an uphill battle to get an A but pulled it off since easy points to get on HW, Labs and projects. Also, Eric is super helpful and understanding. Genuine guy.", 
            "Sometimes he only teaches half the semester, but that half of class you're actually paying attention. He's so passionate about what he does that you don't want to be checking Facebook every 5 minutes. Bell likes to give practical demonstrations of the concepts he's explaining, which really helps you to remember the information.", 
            "Professor Bell is a great guy who truly cares about his students. He loves the material he teaches which makes the students only want to learn more. Going to his class is not mere an academic obligation, but a joy.", 
            "Really, really easy A. Attend lecture and skim the readings and there's no chance you don't do well in the class. Do poorly on one of the quizzes or homeworks? You can easily make up the grade with one of the extra credit assignments. Pretty interesting material as well! Great mini course for sure.", 
            "Very energetic, and fun! He can sometimes bounce around and go too fast but he is a great prof.", 
            "Professor Bell is great, but I do not think he is as fantastic as everyone makes him out to be. He's a great lecturer, but his powerpoint slides can be very confusing; especially when you're studying for the exam and haven't seen them in a while. Astro 101 is very easy. Some practice exam questions are verbatim on actual exams.", 
            "Professor Bell was AMAZING. He's extremely available and very encouraging. He's the better Prof between him and Aller but they both get the job done. He's a great guy.", 
            "He was incredibly fun to have.", 
            "Eric Bell is a fantastic professor. He's entertaining and engaging. He always is sure to add information that will make the lectures interesting. He is not a tough grader because the exams are only multiple choice. I absolutely would recommend his classes", 
            "Professor Bell is very engaging and makes you interested in what he is teaching. He's willing to answer any questions you have during lecture and posts his slides so you can look up information after. He made the class fun and provided demos to make learning memorable.", 
            "I took Astro 106 just to receive one credit. I came out of the class learning new and interesting things. Professor Bell is a nice guy and loves what he teaches.", 
            "Professor Bell is HILARIOUS. Everyone at Umich should take this class at some point. You are basically guaranteed an AA+ if you do one of the stretch assignments and go to class. No final exam!", 
            "Professor Bell was awesome. His lectures were very clear-cut and easy to understand. Astro 106 was a totally worthwhile mini-course, but it did have a lot of coursework, too. That being said, it was the best mini-course I ever took at Michigan, and it definitely got me really interested in astronomy.", 
            "I loved him!!! He was funny and did his best to keep the class interesting. I was only taking this class for natural science credit but, thanks to him, I ended up enjoying it more than I initially thought that I would. I would definitely recommend taking any class with him."

Easy class overall. I put in very little time or effort and got an A. However, this class is graded on very few points (100) which proved difficult for some students.", 
            "Terry was great! His lectures were informative and unbiased. He's pretty funny and made sure to include examples on different levels to adhere to different types of students and their learning. You don't have to do the readings as the test content is lecture-based. Grading is based on few points and your GSI determines a significant chunk of that.", 
            "Terry was a solid choice for Soc 100 - his lectures are interesting and he provides some really cool insight to certain situations. If your mind easily grasps natural science concepts and not social sciences like mine, this class won't be easy. Your grade is heavily determined by how much of the slides you memorize and how nice your GSI is.", 
            "Terrys a cool dude. Made lectures interesting with personal stories. Lots of memorizing and reading (save a group project and paper). Graded on very few points. I put in a lot of work and still almost got an A-. Large part of grade comes down to whether your GSI is lenient or not.", 
            "Terry is the man. The guy is very intelligent and knows his stuff. His lectures are unbiased and entertaining and the requirements for class are pretty clear. Also, you don't have to do the readings to get an A, just pay attention and study the lecture slides, but they're pretty interesting and can't hurt to do", 
            "Terence is great but the class is not an easy A. Lectures were super interesting as Terence always told stories that related to the topic. But the class is graded on close to nothing. 15 pts/exam, 10 pts for paper, 15 its for group project, rest are participation pts and total100 pts.", 
            "Terry is great and a superb professor. Do not take this class for an easy A, although classes are only 2 days a week, there is quite a bit of reading and the exams focus a lot on that reading. Its a point system though so if you do poorly on the exams (like me) you will still be able to gain quite a few point elsewhere.", 
            "DON'T take SOC100 if you want an easy intro class. The material isn't difficult but is graded on few points. An A- isn't too bad to get, but an A takes a solid effort. Lots of reading and memorizing slides. The problem is that it's so easy to lose points. Miss 2 questions on a quiz and your final grade is already down by 1%. Definitely overstudy.", 
            "Terry is one of the best professors I've had at this university. He's kind and incredibly knowledgeable. You DEFINITELY have to show up, do the readings, and put in the work. But if you do, you will be sure to get a good grade. Plus, he's always willing to help outside of class if you need it. He sometimes gives EC for attendance as well.",

He projects his insecurities on traditional students in a condescending manner. At the risk of sounding mean, he's spineless.",

That said, Terry is an exceptional professor, really cares about his students, and is fun to listen to. Just get used to hearing the same story three times. Also, most people are on their laptop most of the class.",

The class is not heavy a heavy load but you genuinely learn a lot. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in what sociology is/ just wants a board understand of the subject.",

Not hard- tests all based solely on lecture (he posts slides as well)",

Dr. Conley is also a pioneer in the field. However, the grading scale makes it so difficult that I would recommend taking it pass/fail. I experienced extreme stress with the grading scale.", 
            "She's a tough grader, and the weight that she puts on only one or two tests can be startling, but good grades are very accessible. Tests are open note and online, though they are very difficult. Beyond this, Prof Conley's lectures are interestingly informative & the guest speakers are profoundly enlightening. Take it if you like talking about sex.", 
            "Terri is an inspirational professor. Her curriculum itself definitely has its flaws, but her research is absolutely fascinating, and she cares about her students. She's very accessible outside of class, so if you're having any issues with the class, go to her and she will teach you study techniques.", 
            "Dr. Conley is a really smart, cool person -- her research is awesome and she integrates it into the curriculum very well. The guest speakers in this course are amazing, and they added a lot of breadth to it. Overall, it's a well-designed, informative course, and I'd take it again in a heartbeat!", 
            "The tests were open book/note thankfully, otherwise, I would have failed them miserably because the info on tests was a bunch of random facts that weren't very relevent. My grade was brought down by the essays we had to turn in, which people at Sweetland said were good, but apparently was not good enough for the class since I got a 78 on them.", 
            "Makes class unnecessarily hard and not very accommodating to individual needs. Would not recommend this class.", 
            "Don't take this class!!!! Tests are online, but there are too many questions. We don't learn much in class and most of the questions on the test are poorly worded. You're not given much help in office hours or review materials. There's a clear anti-men sentiment with this class. Also, there's a curve that hurts your grade!!!", 
            "I took this class because it looked really interesting however Dr. Conley focusses on making the class hard to have students take the class seriously so much that it takes the interesting part out of the class entirely. Tests don't test your knowledge at all and instead test your ability to memorize random facts from the readings and lectures.", 
            "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Trust me! I do my work and study but there is just no way to be successful! Your grade is based off of 1 exam, a LONG paper, and a final! The tests are so specific and it's impossible to do well. This class also has the weirdest grading curve and basically you're doomed for failure. AVOID!", 
            "If you decide to put yourself through this class then take it as pass/fail rather than graded. The exams are intensly specific and overwhelming. Terri makes her class intentionally hard so people take it seriously which is completely unnecessary. Interesting subject material but maybe not worth it. LOTS of outside reading involved.", 
            "Grade is based on exams and the exam are really specific. Had exam question over material that was never given/covered. Have to write 4 essays about guest speakers so attendance is mandatory. Very passionate about what she teachers. Sections are fun but they assume you have a lot of previous experience on \"hooking-up\".", 
            "Dr. C is a wonderful professor! While her classes may consist of some more advanced material, the research she presents is so engaging. She is very accommodating and helpful; I found so many newfound interests because of her. If you take one of her classes and keep up on your work, it is beyond worth it!", 
            "This class was one of the few that felt very personally interactive and fun. We spent a lot of time learning new material, then analyzing and discussing everything as a group. Dr. Conley is great at sparking conversation then letting students take the lead.", 
            "She is passionate about her own work and the work of students. Happy to meet outside of class to help. A lot of the grade was based on a final research project, but the project could be based upon whatever subject you find fascinating within the realm of psychology. This promoted personal development and prepared me for grad school thesis work.", 
            "Dr. Conley is tough, but the class is great.", 
            "Dr. Conley is incredibly smart - her research is groundbreaking and her lectures are fascinating. The best decision of my college career was choosing to take her courses and get involved in her research. You will work hard, but you will learn.", 
            "Dr. Conley is very knowledgable and integrated new research into her lectures, including her own. It was exciting to be taught from someone who is a leading researcher in the field. Grading consists of two exams (which are open book) and four small responses based off guest lectures. The guest lectures are random so attendance is required.", 
            "Dr. Conley is brilliant and pushes her students to expand their thinking. Would take another class with her in a heartbeat!", 
            "Terri is an amazing mentor, professor, and person who puts her all into her work and genuinely cares about her students. She challenges you to think harder and to think differently and to be skeptical of the things society has said about sex, sexuality, and gender. I definitely recommend going to her office hours because she is an incredible person", 
            "Dr. Conley genuinely cares about what she's teaching-especially in such a controversial field. She keeps dialogue open and welcomes pushback on her claims, which is really nice. She's extremely honest. The class is work, but it's really worth it, especially if you're interested in Psychology."

While I highly recommend this class (Engr 100 - Design and the Real World), I warn any potential takers of the workload: it's a lot of work, mainly teamwork. With that said, I will never forget this class or this professor."

            "I don't understand the point of lecture for this class, I began doing better when I realized how ridiculous this class was, and I got sick of hearing Rabkin finding a biblical or sexual reference in EVERYTHING. I stopped going to lecture about half way through the course and still got full scores on all my papers, even for books I never opened.", 
            "like the people below me said, one of the people in my section knew that the stuff he said about one of the books was wrong and let him know, and he ignored her and never corrected the error. he has pet theories - most of them about straight sex and/or the bible - and ignores what does not fit. also rude, arrogant. good booklist though!", 
            "His research for one of the books was flat out incorrect. When a student went through the trouble of finding the research to back up her claim and point out what was wrong with his research, he ignored her. His refusal to correct his misinformation and his dismissal of her were disrespectful. His readings are male-centric and hetero-centric.", 
            "The short weekly papers that \"enrich the reading of an intelligent senior in the class\" are supposed to improve writing skills, but mine has gotten worse - I'm so worried about word count. His teaching style is often unprofessional, like stopping lecture and causing more distraction than anything to yell at someone for talking while he is.", 
            "He makes it seem as if your attendance in lecture is absolutely necessary, but it's not. In fact, the readings are discussed in the class sessions following the due date for the assignment on them. His interpretations of the texts (sexual readings 80% of the time!) are usually way out there and not helpful at all.", 
            "he's extremely smart, has an interesting way of looking at things, and he's pretty entertaining. he's also obsessed with himself. plus, a wonderful reading list was inhibited by the way the papers - focusing on very short strictly graded papers rather than longer ones where you can develop a lot more ideas. not the worst class, but disappointing.", 
            "He is an egoist, but he's an intelligent, knowledgeable, and entertaining egoist. He gives good lectures and expects a lot out of his students. You'll learn a lot writing the papers for this class. The grading scale is weird, but it lets you have some freedom over what to write on and when."

            "He's a good choice for a 9 am lecture and honestly as long as you understand every slid (literally every slid) you will be solid on the exams. Very nice during office hours.", 
            "Mckay is a good and respected professor. He is a good professor to start your 9am class with and he was my motive for getting up early, other than iclicker points. The material and homework is very hard, but he does a pretty good job explaining the material. He is fun during office hours, although I wish he had more of them.", 
            "Great prof, really enjoyed class with him. Hes very highly respected at Umich and around the world, but will always answer questions after class. Super nice person, one example being the fact he allowed people to postpone an exam because Umich had to allow Richard Spencer to speak on campus, upsetting many students.", 
            "The tests and material in this class can be difficult but McKay is really great at explaining concepts. The clicker questions will keep you on your toes and will prompt you to talk with those around you in order to get an answer or compare the one you had, and possibly learn from other people too. Also super helpful during office hours!", 
            "Tim is an amazing professor. He is energetic and friendly and I am actually able to pay attention in a 9am lecture. He is always willing to answer questions and help students. Tests can be hard but using extra resources can help.", 
            "Incredibly knowledgable combined with an amazing teaching ability means Tim McKay is an excellent professor", 
            "Deep Time is one of the most interesting classes you could take at UMich! It covers an incredible depth and breadth of fascinating aspects of science, and McKay does a phenomenal job with the lectures to make them interesting. The new grading system- gradecraft- also makes it a lot of work, but extremely easy to get an A. I highly recommend it!!!", 
            "I have decidedly mixed feelings on Professor McKay. For the most part, he's helpful and interesting, but sometimes seems a bit peacockish. Overall good, though.", 
            "He's passionate about physics but the class itself IS NOT easy! Going to office hours definitely helps and he will explain things to you that you're having trouble with. I also watched chapter reviews and concepts videos on Study Edge. They also have practice probs which helped me study A LOT!", 
            "I thought this class was reasonable and fair. McKay was very good at explaining things during office hours and seemed interested in his student's learning. A lot of people didn't like him and preferred Zuchowski, but I thought both did a good job", 
            "Yes he may know his stuff but this does not make him a good professor. Rarely answers emails and his exams did not resemble past exams/examples. Averages were extremely low and he did not adjust his grading scale like other semesters. Do not recommend taking him.", 
            "Prof. McKay is one of the best profs I've had at umich. He explains the concepts very clearly and is very enthusiastic in lecture. He also is very helpful if you need help understanding something. Great prof.", 
            "Fantastic. Very enthusiastic about physics. Great at explaining concepts and very approachable. Highly recommend", 
            "Physics is a hard class with any professor, but McKay really does try his best to make sure his students understand. Sometimes his questions do overreach to try to make you apply concepts further, and exams ARE hard, but I'd suggest getting into a study group or with a group of people to go over the physics material and concepts.", 
            "This class was one of the worst I took. The mastering physics homework is to tedious and frustrating. The lectures got ahead of the reading, and the reading was confusing, full of typos, rambled and did not prepare you for the test. The tests were always way harder than what they prepared you for.", 
            "Great, helpful professor, I really enjoyed attending his lectures. The exams were difficult, but they don't make up you're entire grade which helps. He's very fair and adjusts his grading scale if needed. Not a physics fan, but I'm very glad I had the chance to be in his class.", 
            "Terrible professor, makes the content extremely confusing. I tried all semester to learn from lecture but kept finding myself in awe that he can be that confusing. He is unhelpful (I emailed him and he suggested cliche' ideas) and just the worst teacher I've ever had.", 
            "His exams are really hard, even if you study a lot. Very low averages. Great Professor though. Willing to answer your questions.", 
            "Ok lecturer, poor on responding to e-mails, not enough office hours and no example problems in his \"book\" aka a coursepack.", 
            "While physics was THEE last class I had any interested in taking, I am glad I took it with McKay. He is a brilliant researcher and professor with a great down-to-earth personality. Always willing to help and definitely loves what he's doing. A very challenging class but they do try to structure it so you have other ways to make up for exam score"

He has a dry sense of humor, but can be really sweet at times like a teddy bear! Also if you are well prepared for umich, his CSP course puts you at the same level as everybody else.",

Mike makes it more than possible for you to get in the class. Definitely take his section, HE WILL LET YOU IN EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT IN CSP!! It's so worth the extra day.",

He also understands that we are not taking this class to master physics and often complains about how awful the course is set up. He really tries to help you out and sympathize with you. I highly respect him as a lecturer.",

Additionally, he has a ton of the office hours in the help room which are really helpful and I recommend attending. I was dreading taking physics and Dr. Mike made the experience so much less treacherous and manageable.",

He made it a class that I was able to get an excellent grade in. He goes above and beyond for his students. Dr. Mike is amazing.",

            "Dr. Mike is the best! Everything was clear, his exam reviews are very comprehensive, and he's actually pretty funny. The class is five days a week instead of four but so worth the exam review days. Dr. Mike spends tons of hours in the help room during exam week and is willing to move around office hours to help. Highly recommend him for physics!", 
            "Dr. Mike is a truly awesome professor. I'm not a math wiz by any means and physics is really hard for me, but Dr. Mike is funny and honestly wants his students to do well. Class is five times a week compared to four but that leaves, usually, four days review before an exam. His reviews are very good and very comprehensive of the exams. Recommended!", 
            "BEST SCIENCE PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD IN UOFM! I didn't take physics in high school and this is my first physics class in UOFM(so I was scared in the beginning). I love going to his class because I know I am going to get out of class knowing everything I need to know. He is very helpful and clear no need to read the book I simply love him :)",

            "I'm a sophomore and Gavin is by far the best professor I've had thus far. Calc 4 is definitely a hard class, but his lectures explain concepts in such a way that is thorough, but not intimidating. A large role in that is his constant goofy personality, and his dad jokes. His office hours are also very helpful, it's basically a review lecture.", 
            "Gavin is the greatest guy ever. Differential equations is a very hard class, and requires lots of work. However, he is always willing to help. His lectures are a MUST. They aren't mandatory, but they are engaging, funny, and really helpful. Sometimes our lecture was more than full because students in other sections wanted to attend his lecture.", 
            "He is literally the nicest guy ever. He genuinely cares that you learn and is more than willing to meet with you for help outside the class. If you have to take Calc 4, take it with him.", 
            "He believes you learn nothing unless you suffer. Which is great because you do learn but it is so sressfull and hard. But he's a great prof. Srsly. Lectures are super funny, he's hilarious. Super open and friendly, office hours are a must, go even if you have nothing to say. He's one of the few profs who actually care how you're doing.", 
            "I have heard many good things about Calc 4 and how it was the easier load of the math courses. Having to take Eecs 215, I needed a good understanding on the topics covered in Calc 4. Gavin made the class overly difficult and his tests were so conceptual to the point where I couldn't understand much of the actual material. Would not recommend.", 
            "Dr. Larose is a great professor! He teaches the material and then has the entire class do examples to help solidify/use the concepts. This really helped me learn the material. The other professors were so bad this semester that Larose's lectures were always past max capacity. He's a fun guy that truly cares about the success of his students.", 
            "Math 216 was supposed to be a very easy class, but this semester has turned into a GPA nightmare. Professor Larose is decent as a professor, but the exams, written homework and labwork were all insanely difficult. The book required (Brannan & Boyce) was awful, and the class just ended up sucking and killing GPAs left and right.", 
            "Though math 216 is extremely hard, but he tries his best to make everyone succeed. He is the best!", 
            "He should NOT be a course coordinator. Combination of written homework + long webwork was brutal. Exams were obscenely hard (the average in my section - 50%). No solutions to the exams we took, or the PRACTICE PROBLEMS - Gsi's gave different answers to the questions and were unwilling to do them all. Lectures between sections: wildly inconsistent.", 
            "While he's a good teacher, he took DiffEq from being the easiest of the required engineering math classes to being by far the most difficult of the classes. Homework takes an incredibly long amount of time. The exams were nearly impossible. He made this class feel like an honors course Avoid taking while he's course coordinator at all costs.",

Somehow, in a course of over 100 students, he seems to connect with every one and makes a clear effort to fit every students individual need. His class is hard, but he goes about teaching in such an effective way that I have yet to see duplicated in my time here. Amazing teacher.",

This semester in 216, his section had the highest exam averages of the other lecturer and his lecture section was always too crowded because of how many people wanted to be in his section. He is very enthusiastic and very entertaining; easily one of the best teachers I've had.", 
            "This class is notoriously hard and Gavin is the guy you want teaching it. While there isn't much lecturing (class is all group proof work. READ before class or you'll understand nothing) Gavin is enthusiastic, entertaining, and available to help. His sections are consistently above course average on exams.", 
            "His 425 section requires more work than others, and he readily admits that. Despite that he's very helpful in lecture and office hours and one of the best and most entertaining lecturers I've had. I would specifically take math classes just to have him as a professor.", 
            "Best professor/class I've taken! There's a lot of work, but class was always very engaging and gave me a much better understanding of the material. Prof. LaRose was always energetic and enthusiastic, and it makes the class much more interesting and fun. Definitely worth taking. You'll learn a ton.", 
            "Professor Larose is one of the greatest professors I've had at the University. He really cares about the success of all his students. He answers all your questions and gets back to your email within a couple of hours! Very helpful. If you want to/have to take 217, I highly recommend you take it with him!", 
            "Gavin is the best. As a person he is very easy going and fun, and as a professor he is intelligent, understanding, and very helpful. One of the best profs I've ever had. The work load is demanding. Going to office hours helps a lot. 217 is hard and a weeder class, but having Gavin made things less stressful",

Not easy subject matter, but Prof. Larose is a top notch instructor. Makes things clear and intuitive; very friendly and witty. Would 110% take him again. TAKE HIS CLASS IF YOU CAN; you won't be disappointed.",

            "A funny guy. A great personality and really wants to impress students with demos and such. Not great at explaining things, but you can easily get an A if you play your cards right.", 
            "Both 235 professors teach at a level nearly no one understands. I think they assume we know much more than we do. That being said, most problems on the exams are from old exams but not to the extent of how it was for 135 . Chupp is the better prof of the two as Toby subbed in for a dozen or so lectures due to Chupp's traveling.", 
            "Dr. Chupp is clearly very well-versed on the material, but he should be teaching a higher level and smaller physics class. Lectures are extremely boring, iclicker questions are hard and he never seems to really get the point across. Exams are really easy though, and he allows a notecard for every exam. An easy A but I wouldn't recommend Chupp.", 
            "Physics 235 is the worst course I've taken at UM. It's not well designed. Dr. Chupp tried to make classes more interesting with experiments and examples, but he ended up skipping lots of more important concepts and rushing through question solving process. Classes are not helpful but you have to attend because iclicker Qs take up 25% of the grade.", 
            "Neither 235 instructor was excellent this semester, but Chupp is alright. His slides are more organized and complete than Eckhause's. The class itself is just a mess as it was being taught at a higher level than appropriate. They need to reorganize the -35 sequence to spend more time on more important material and less on things like quantum.", 
            "Dr. Chupp is an excellent professor! His lectures were really interesting and he makes a lot of jokes which keeps students engaged. His exams, as expected, were challenging and made you think. His grading is fair and he is very helpful when you talk to him or email him about your performance. I'd advise students to take Dr. Chupp for Physics 235.", 
            "just a very average prof, teaching a very difficult class. going to his lectures will not be especially helpful, but one on one he is a little better. he gets very excited about the theoretical concepts of physics 235, but doesn't seem concerned that everyone in his class is there because they HAVE to be, and most struggle with material.", 
            "Lectures were a bit confusing, but if he definitely knows what he's talking about. If you ask him questions individually, he's much better at explaining concepts. He's very nice, and pretty funny- he jokes around with students a lot, which made lecture a lot more interesting.", 
            "Smart, nice guy. He is very willing to help if you ask. Also, his tests are fair and he grades VERY generously. Yes, sometimes he makes mistakes on the board, but who doesn't? It didn't take away from the class at all.", 
            "Sometimes his lectures were off topic, but they always contained interesting physics knowledge. He takes the theoretical approach to electromagnetism very seriously, and I rarely ever used a calculator. He's not the greatest teacher, but he gets the job done if you're willing to put forth the effort.", 
            "While he knows his stuff, he isn't very good at conveying it to the class. He is hard to follow when he lectures resulting in difficult homework. However, he is very willing to help you if you ask for it. He even set up a study hall in the Phy Help Room just for his class, though if he were a better lecturer he wouldn't need it. Hard homework.", 
            "Bad. Doesn't lecture well, very disorganized and unpredictable. Also arrogant. Not sure what I'm learning in this class.", 
            "Explanations do NOT make sense. It is difficult to follow what he is trying to do. He makes jumps and CONSTANTLY makes errors during lecture that are up for about 5 mins or longer until they get corrected. *He does this even while lecturing from his notes). I couldn't follow what he was doing when he was explaining something i was already taught", 
            "This professor lectured in a clear manner that I found easy to understand. He graded in a fair manner, and the homework/exams always reflected the covered material. I won't lie and say the class was a cake-walk, but honestly, he teaches physics, not english composition. If you put in the effort, you will learn a large amount.", 
            "He seemed like a decent guy, but most of his lectures tended to stray from the material that we needed to know. Don't worry though, because his exams were rather easy.", 
            "his lectures are a waste of time. and nobody would attend if he hadn't added the quizdom, i went to sleep though about half the lectures and am doing fine in the class. practice tests are the most helpful and his tests are pretty fair.", 
            "He's not a bad professor and the exams aren't that hard, but most of what I learned in this class I learned on my own or from the GSI's. A lot of his explanations made things seem more complicated than they needed to be.", 
            "seems like a nice guy, but not a great lecturer. His thoughts do not connect. He can never fit a lecture in the time alloted. His demos are all of a needle moving in a meter or a laser beam on a wall. Exams are pretty fair though. Teach yourself from the book and you'll be fine.", 
            "Tim should not be teaching undergrads. Let me list the things that do not matter in this class: lecture, discussion, qwizdom, and homework. all that matters is that you can teach yourself the material before the test. do not expect exam questions to be at all like the homework. lectures will be boring. every one of his demonstations wont work.", 
            "This is the first science class at UM I haven't got an A in, including orgo 1 & 2. Point is, no matter how smart or studious you are, he'll find a way to make you do poorly. If not for my discussion teacher, Dan, I might have failed this class because Chupp's exams are nothing like practice exams, HW or anything we've ever seen before in lecture."

The exams make up almost the entire grade and he gives a study guide that has everything on it. Know the study guide get a somewhat easy A.", 
            "Chivens is a really nice guy who you can tell is genuinely passionate about his classes. His lectures can be boring, but if you miss a few it's no big deal. He publishes a comprehensive exam study guide before every exam, so as long as you do them you'll get a great grade with minimal effort. This class is low stress, and is an easy 4 credits.", 
            "He's straightforward and will let you know what is on tests beforehand. The lectures arent exceptionally fun, but some of the topics are just dry. He is a caring prof and I really liked him.", 
            "I took this class for a requirement and I regret it. Pr Chivens is really nice and can be funny, but the lectures are so boring it is impossible to pay attention. Attendance is mandatory for discussion. Tests are no all multiple choice, there is fill in the blank and also short answer. Only take this class if you're interested in the subject.", 
            "Brings in relevant examples to lecture and is a really nice guy, but class is too intense for 100-level anthro. Reading load of a 300 level humanities class, an extra project, and then the usual lectures. I heard other profs for the class don't assign/test on nearly this much reading. This class takes more time than my upper level science classes.", 
            "Really nice and cares about his students. Not the most entertaining lecturer, but he can be pretty funny and there are often guest lecturers. He also gives very clear, comprehensive review guides for each exam (super helpful)!", 
            "Really nice and cares about his students. Gives very clear, comprehensive study guides for each exam. Not the most entertaining lectures, but he can be funny and there are often guest lecturers.", 
            "Professor Chivens seemed to ramble on and on in lecture, but if you pay attention for the entirety of lecture, then you can grasp some information that will prove extremely helpful for the exams. Honestly, you don't have to do the readings, listen in lecture, and attend discussion and you'll get an A.", 
            "Incredible difficult to understand. Extremely boring lecturer. Makes the class have almost no clear goal to it.", 
            "This class if easy. I never did the readings but I did go to lecture and basically just sit and listen but not engage all that much and I did just fine. Be ready to disagree with a lot of the stuff this class tries to teach but just have to let it go. Tests are super easy too, only 50 minutes and mostly multiple choice.", 
            "Prof. Chivens is very laid back; at least in the Spring Term, he cares more about discussing the material rather than going through the motions of a PowerPoint slide. This makes an ostensibly boring intro class very engaging. He is also extremely approachable both in and outside of class. His exams are very straightforward as well.", 
            "Amazing class which makes you think differently about the society we are raised in. The tests are based exactly on the review guide so if you memorize that you can get an easy A. There were a few papers but they weren't too long.", 
            "The concepts are simple to understand, easy, and surprisingly accurate to life outside the classroom. The lectures are sort of random and it is hard to follow where he is going or what needs to be taken from said lectures. However, for all three exams there is a study guide with everything you need to know, so the aimlessness is tolerable.", 
            "Chivens is pretty easy, but so hard to follow in lecture. He is a great guy, but does not lecture in a way that is engaging or easy to follow at all. Overall, I would recommend this class just because it is pretty interesting and it's not too hard.", 
            "I took Anthro to take care of distribution but full enjoyed the course because of Chivens! He's lively, funny, and explains most course material very well. He tries to keep reading assignments to a minimum, and assignments are manageable. He creates a class that is interesting and fairly low-maintenance.", 
            "Lectures are boring but helpful. Gives study guides that clearly state what is on the test. Discussion is boring but participation matters.",

He means well, but doesn't get several of the required readings include dubious consent that got difficult to read and engage with. To him, they're just stories, not real life.", 
            "He's the stereotypical english professor with a tweed coat, which I absolutely love. He is also a knowledgeable, effective historian that genuinely cares how well he can teach you. If you have trouble, he is more than willing to discuss things one on one with you. You need to know how to read and write effective for this course.", 
            "Great teacher on interesting topics. Be careful, because his tender English accent might lull you to sleep.", 
            "This class sounded super interesting, but I was bored by week two. We had a few online timed writing assignments and papers, but he took forever to get them back to us. Nice guy, but very unorganized professor.", 
            "Wonderful guy, not a wonderful teacher. He is very passionate and knowledgable about everything Russian, and he just assumes you are too. If you aren't, prepare to fake it. Lots of reading, lots of discussions. On the plus, he's a sweetheart, very quick to praise. Contribute to class and show a sense of humor, he'll like you.", 
            "Don't expect him to tell you what's coming up... It's a lot of reading but you feel like you're in a phd program. Brilliant is an understatement. Subtle humor is fantastic! It's like listening to poetry when he speaks.", 
            "I wish I had listened. This guy is stupidly difficult for a 1 credit class. 70 pages of dry reading/week, class attendance only counts if you get the I-clicker question right, and his final paper is half the grade and is graded absurdly hard. It brought me down a full letter grade. Sounds awesome at first, but avoid this class at all costs.", 
            "this class was awful. it ended two months ago and i still dont have my grade back. worst mini course you could possibly take", 
            "Michael is an excellent professor. He is incredibly knowledgeable. Rumor had been that he was pompous, basically, but really, he is clever, knows all about his topics, and if you study the material like you should at a 300 level course, you will have no problem. The course is Russia Today, and it's one of the most interesting I've taken. STUDY!", 
            "WORST CLASS EVER. Assigns 80 pages of reading per week for a 1-credit minicourse and grades the paper (75% of grade) like its a 500 level English class. Absolutely absurd. REPEAT, DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS MAN.", 
            "Took this 1 credit course for the humanities credit. He assigned way too much reading for a 1 credit course (generally 3-5 hours a week). Expected a pretty vast prior knowledge of Russian history. Lectures were dull, and this course became the most dreaded 2 hours of my week.", 
            "If you are taking this as ULWR/RE/HU credit, then take it Pass/Fail. In class, we had a difficult time understanding when reading was due. Also, papers were extremely difficult to get an A on. Normally, only those who have prior knowledge on Russian history get the A. However, if you have trouble, then Makin is very understanding and approachable.", 
            "Prof Makin's lectures are marginal at best. If you are taking his class for just your UPWR & RE at the same time then don't. Don't. This isn't an easy grade and it doesn't mesh well with pre-professional majors. It IS a 300 level Russian class, think about that before signing up. The paper topics are vague and your paper is strictly graded.", 
            "Professor Makin is definitely a great professor and he managed to make his material engaging and interesting. However, I found the paper topics a little abstract and unclear sometimes, which makes it hard to write about. Also as an ULWR, it is weird that they don't teach you how to write well.Maybe I have the wrong expectation for this class.", 
            "Hmmm...sounds like the person below me is upset about his essay that is due at 11:55pm tonight (which, by the way, we've had over 2 weeks to complete). Due to a character limit I cannot truly express what a sensational person he is, so all I will say is if you can take a class with Makin, seize the opportunity to learn from a wonderful teacher!", 
            "This class is terrible. Makin doesn't respond to emails at all, is very long-winded & apt to waste class time going off on tangents, and vague in assignment guidelines. My writing has seriously gotten worse in this class; grading for writing is ridiculously subjective, at times even contradicting structure and style taught in my ENGLISH 125 class", 
            "He is a great professor. I would say the workload was very managable and not burdensome at all. Prof. Makin is very accomodating and enjoys having good conversation about the topics being covered. Come prepared for class and you will become very engaged during lecture. Great class and great professor!",

Interesting course, but workload is unbearable (at least for spring term). Good if you want to get many requirements completed (ULW, RE, HU). Would recommend for those w/ prior knowledge and strong interest in Russia.",

            "I knew from the first day of class that she was going to be horrible; I am not looking forward to having her for the semester. She made it explicitly clear that an A is exceptional work, even though it is an introductory class for English. So sad.", 
            "She's very disorganized and is frequently late to class. Not only that, her feedback consists of a few words which ends up being a several letter drop. She often pushes back deadlines because of her lack of organization and it's overall a very frustrating class.", 
            "Save your GPA and do not pick Jaimien Delp! Our class discussions were annoying repetitive. It was the same talk about a poem and workshop other people's essays! She never told us how to become a better writer! Like honestly, I expected much more. She grades harshly for no reason! She always wants your \"voice\" and more detail. Get a life!", 
            "Did not enjoy her class. She brought politics into the classroom a few times and it wasn't comfortable because she was pushing a certain agenda... it's one thing to have discussions, it's another to make a student feel ashamed. Not only that, her criticisms were not very helpful and left me feeling helpless as I didn't know how to improve my work",

Whether you like english or hate it, you can't find a bad thing to say about her. Loved being in a class that was laid back but also drove you to better yourself as a writer and a person. 10/10 recommend. PS she's a dime",

Wouldn't call it an easy A, but if you're a good writer and participate in her class you will do well. She's so lax and going to class was low-key enjoyable.",

At the beginning of the semester she told us it would be difficult to get an A, and it may just be that I'm a strong writer, but I also went to office hours a ton and she was very helpful.

She doesn't have any tests - but for the essays go to her office hours - she's very nice and wants to help you. If you put in the time to do the readings, you'll do very well.", 
            "Professor Disch is very into this course! She really enjoys in-lecture participation. I only went to office hours once, but she still learned my name just by participating! The material can be a bit boring. Run your essays/commentary ideas past your GSI to make sure you do well. Overall, not my favorite material, but Professor Disch is great!",

            "Most boring class I've ever been enrolled in in my 7 semesters at the University of Michigan. No point to anything learned, and the GSI definitely does not make it any better with his dull, pointless classes. The quizzes are 2/week and are annoying. Three papers that are short but dense. If there were exams, I'd fail. Waste of my time.",

The lectures are mandatory with Iclicker questions for attendance and the lectures are SO boring. A lot of annoying quizzes and 3 papers. Only good thing about this class was NO TESTS, but still the most mediocre experience. BORING, GSI BASED, NO TESTS.", 
            "Prof disch was fine, very knowledgeable and kind but I really didn't enjoy the way the lectures worked. It was essentially her calling on students to share their ideas the whole time. This didn't really work for me as I wanted to learn from her, not some random student in my class sharing their often wrong ideas.",

Attendance is mandatory (clickers) but most people are on their laptops. Two mini writings a week, open everything quiz on Fridays, and three papers culminate into a pretty simple class. Highly recommend!", 
            "Dr. Disch is extremely intelligent and quick-witted, making her lectures quite engaging and interesting. There were no exams, only 3 major papers, participation, weekly Canvas reading quizzes & re-caps which you have plenty of time to complete. Only downside is that the grades are ultimately determined by your GSI, luckily mine was very reasonable.", 
            "Lisa is incredible. You can tell that she really cares about all of her students. Who else takes the time to try and learn the names of 200+ students? The actual content is dry, but she makes it engaging. The class is based mostly on writing assignments that are graded pretty harshly.", 
            "her lectures are thought provoking and extremely interesting but they become drier as the course progresses. She really loves what she's doing and is such a kind hearted woman and she tries her best to leave what she believes out of her lectures which I appreciate. However, your grade is determined by 3 essays- and the GSI's are pretty tough",

            "I really enjoyed taking this class! Overall, Dr Disch is very funny and her lectures are very clear. The class is doable and the readings aren't that bad. However, your grade heavily depends on your GSI and mine was pretty tough. No final, two essays and a final commentary. If you are on top of things, it is totally doable!", 
            "Good teacher but her lectures can get dry and repetitive. Your grade relies on only a few papers so you have to go to office hours and do well on each to get a good grade. GSIs can be tough graders too.", 
            "My favorite professor by far. I have never ever been able to sit through an entire lecture without feeling tempted to look at my phone or laptop, until I took this class. I didn't have to distract myself because I enjoyed the way she taught it kept me very engaged.", 
            "Best professor I've had in my four semesters so far. She's not only very intelligent, but she knows how to teach material so well. She's incredibly enthusiastic and has the best dad humor in the world. The class itself was graded on three short papers, a project and then attendance and participation (aka iClicker in lecture). Awesome class."

            "Professor Brandwein is absolutely amazing!! Hands down the best PoliSci professor I've had at UM. She is brilliant and her lectures fly by, I enjoyed every moment of her class. That said you do have to work for your grade but you walk out of her class with a plethora of knowledge you can use in other courses and the legal world. AMAZING course!!!", 
            "Professor Brandwein is an amazing professor. It's rare for me to enjoy a lecture when it's an hour and a half long, but Pamela is extremely engaging and made the class fly by. I VERY MUCH recommend always attending her lectures because it makes the class MUCH easier. She is extremely intelligent, and appears to genuinely love teaching!",

            "Pamela is one of the best professors I have ever had at the University of Michigan. Though her class challenged me, it was extremely eye opening and profound. She pushes her students to learn through analysis and discovery rather than just giving you the answer, and left me wanting to make the world a better place. Her passion is contagious.", 
            "The best political science professor in the department. Professor Brandwein is extremely intelligent, a very engaging professor, and cares a LOT about her students' progress. She is very challenging, but that is what makes her incredible. She is also really helpful in office hours, so don't be intimidated. Don't miss either of her 400 levels!", 
            "Boring professor. Do not take any class from her. Professor Brandwein made very clear from the beginning that she would favor only people who agreed with her ideological views. I spent the rest of the semester parroting what she said and got an A. Still, I regret taking the class. Prof. Brandwein can be condescending to different viewpoints.", 
            "Prof. Brandwein is absolutely wonderful. Lectures are extremely engaging. Class time passed very quickly. Material is very interesting especially if there is interest in the subject. She doesn't use powerpoints in class though, so I would recommend actually going to class (though she doesn't take attendance). One of my favorite profs & class at UM.", 
            "Prof. Brandwein is brilliant and at the top of her field. I highly respect her as a teacher. However, the class is a lot of work. Worth it if you're super into the subject and willing to read and write. Thanks for teaching me so much, Prof! Great GSI too!", 
            "The class was interesting (history of human rights) and Pamela seems to actually know a lot about the issues. However, she would ramble in her lectures, and frequently run out of time getting to the actual topic. An overall easy class, with a fair amount of the grade on group work", 
            "I think Pam Brandwein is a brilliant professor. She is patient, methodical and extremely eager to help students in the class. This is rare from a professor, especially at a research based university like Michigan. I don't think I did as well as I want, but that was also because I didn't try as hard. Put in the effort and you'll be fine.",

It's not too difficult to do well in her class, you just need to keep up on the readings and stay engaged in class. I do, however, feel if you disagree with her ideologically she grades you much harsher.",

Her lectures are incredibly repetitive as she just stands there and talks for the entire 90 minutes every time. No textbook or slides so you pretty much have to go to lecture. Found it hard to consistently pay attention.",

You'll learn a lot about Reconstruction and the Supreme Court in 319, but to get an A you really need to do a large amount of work. A very hard Political Science. Good luck with GSIs..."

Exam material was random and never prepared for beforehand. The project expectations never were clear from the start which means no one really knows how there gona do", 
            "Fred's a nice guy, but has no idea how to teach an entry level engineering class. He goes off topic during lectures and rambles about concepts that are much higher level than the class, like what he did in his professional career, yet he explains required material only briefly. On the positive side, he was interested in your labs and helped often.", 
            "A lot of people in my class had a problem with his teaching but I didn't think it was too bad. He covered topics pretty fast and I felt lost on a lot of the homework assignments but I also felt ready for the exams when they came around. It is true that he goes off on tangential topics related to higher level EECS courses though", 
            "Would give him a zero if possible. The syllabus is extremely unstructured and lectures are confusing and boring. Decided to give me a B+ even though I received 90+% due to insufficient participation. There is no clear mention in the syllabus of how participation contributes to your grade so he can basically decide to increase or decrease your grade", 
            "Fred Terry is a terrible professor for Freshman students. There is a complete disconnect between the information that he expects us to know and what we do know. He teaches us like we are higher level EECS students even though we are first semester freshman. All around his class was a terrible experience as he is also extremely boring.", 
            "He's got an issue with being way too in the weeds. Everyone knows someone like that: the guy who can't stop talking about the weird minutia of how circuits work without actually saying anything educational. That's Prof. Terry. Nice, but can't get to the point to save his life. Just teach yourself circuits with the Internet.", 
            "The most boring man in history.", 
            "Was irrationally difficult for a 100 section. He didn't relate at all to college freshmen and babbled about things completely irrelevant to the course. Didn't answer questions when someone was brave enough to ask.", 
            "You'll love your semester with Prof Terry. He's a kind and charismatic guy that makes you adore EECS (until later on!). He's extremely clear, and he was a major component of my happiness in being in EECS. Beware his final though, I love the guy, but his final dropped me down from an A- to a B+!", 
            "Never have a clue about what he is \"teaching.\"", 
            "Because of long homeworks, it's easy to regret taking Terry's section of 215, but you will finish the semester saying that you learned a lot. The material is very important for future EE courses. It's easy to have a part of a problem in homework that you don't get to. First exam is easy, the rest are hard. The curve is fair.", 
            "Fred Terry is super cute. The circuits he draws are also cute. He's really into the subject, and sometimes has too much passion, but he keeps us laughing with his quirks. Homework becomes longer the further you get into the semester, but really help in understanding the material if you start early. Book is helpful but not needed", 
            "Terry is a great professor. He really cares about your education and is super passionate about EE. He also cares about diversity and inclusion which is really refreshing in the EECS department. The homework assignments were fairly easy except for 2-3 that took me about 10-12 hours each. The exams are VERY generously graded with partial credit.", 
            "Homeworks are long. Start them early, and learn them thoroughly. Every problem contributes something to help build the whole concept in your mind. If you understand every homework problem, studying for exams will take no time at all. Put in the work and you will be rewarded. Terry is an outstanding and hilarious professor who really cares about you", 
            "FTJ (Fred Terry Jr.) is a funny, quirky dude who genuinely loves teaching EECS 215 and wants students to do well. 215 is not easy, but if you try decently hard you should be able to get an A. Weekly homework sets took me 3 hrs for easy ones, up to 12 hours for the hardest one. Exams are super forgiving w/ partial credit. FTJ is very helpful in OH", 
            "If you do your homework, pay attention in class and go to office hours you will be fine. Homework is everything in this class. Every week's homework is long and difficult. He gives a lot of answers to homework problems in office hours though and is pretty solid at explaining how to do everything. Understanding the HW understanding the test.", 
            "Prof. Terry is actually a fairly good instructor to have for 215. Problem sets are tough and time taking, and you may regret taking the class with him, but you will look back and say that you learned a lot. Tests can be tough, but grades are assigned fairly. The class can only be curved in your favor, sometimes fairly generously.", 
            "He's a really great professor. He really loves what he does and is really willing to help anyone, you just have to ask. A lot of times he'll go off tangent just because he loves the subject so much so he'll talk about stuff not on exams, but it's still awesome. He's really the reason I stayed in EE, just seeing how much he loves it.", 
            "The way problem sets work is there are many problems that you can easily get done in about 4 or 5 hours altogether. Then there is the Terry question that itself can take up to 7 or 8 hours to do. First exam is usually easy. The next two are much harder, but the class is curved. You will leave the class confident in circuit analysis though.", 
            "I really loved Terry as a professor. Nice guy, VERY passionate about electrical engineering and you can tell he really wants his students to learn. 215 is definitely a weeder class, but is not bad if you put in the work. (from reading previous reviews, it looks like he toned down the problem sets, none of them took longer than 10-12 hours max)"

Exams are difficult (multiple choice, multiple choice with more than one answer, and free response) and there's only three, but participation buffers them and his reviews are helpful.",

Exams are very tough (though very doable), especially coming from 172, and his love for molecular biology clearly shines through. Overall solid course, but less about humans than you might anticipate.", 
            "It is pity he is so underrated on here. You can really feel that any kind of discussion is welcome to him. Feeds students with scientific thinking and mindsets besides hard facts. If you plan to become a scientist, this is a must take course. The only drawback i can think of is that BIO205 is as difficult as any other 400 courses.",

            "Very smart guy, clicker questions are participatory, no homework, a few flipped classes that are for participation. He engages the class and is very helpful outside of class. Tests are not too difficult, you need to study and be able to apply the concepts in class, not just memorize them. Don't need book because you're only graded on lectures",

If you study the lectures and LEARN the genetic and biological concepts he and Dr. Buttita want you to know, you will enjoy this course. Study the material (it's good stuff) and ask good Qs",

He's very approachable and goes the extra mile if you ask for help. Go to his office hours! They were super helpful and he's fun to talk to. But don't be fooled, the exams are still very difficult.",

            "Challenging class. He makes the information more convoluted than it has to be, partly because he's so enthusiastic about the field that he tends to go too in depth on the material and go off on tangents. Assumes that we've completely synthesized information from previous lectures and previous biology classes without reinforcing the material.",

            "He made the class way harder than it should have been. Said it was a prereq for Bio305 (genetics) but this class didn't help me at all. His tests are way too hard and he fishes for precise answers that are impossible to know", 
            "Interesting lectures, but feels a bit long at times. Very passionate about his subject and gets his students passionate as well. Exam philosophy is application, not memorization. Very attentive to his students' needs and actively tries to engage the whole class. Don't bother with the text.",

He will stay at office hours for long periods after they're supposed to be over. 210 lectures are as informative as any other upper level biology class, which probably is a surprise to some who see the 200 level and think it will be easy. The exams are very difficult, but there is a hefty curve.", 
            "Still not entirely sure how I ended up in this class but I really enjoyed it. Not a lot of memorization, the exams test how well you can apply the research techniques and understand the different model organisms. Studied a couple days before the exam every time and did fine. Cadigan is the man, wish I went to office hours more.",

I didn't find the exams or article critiques to be difficult, but the grading can be nitpicky-- it really depends on the GSI.", 
            "Harder than I thought it would be. It's only a 200level, but the article critiques are graded harshly, and even if you go to your GSI or her, they won't necessarily tell you how to write them better. They want you to think on your own (same with the lecture material). Then again Professor Young is a very caring person so the class wasn't that bad.", 
            "For the most part, she kept the lecture material interesting by incorporating both relevant and intriguing videos, and she presented the concepts in ways that made them easy to understand.", 
            "Dr. Young is passionate and always keeps her students engaged. Anthrarc 285 is a Race & Ethnicity and Social Science credit and I enjoyed the class. We talked about Big Foot and UFOs, she always keeps it fun. It's not a super easy A, the GSIs graded tough and our first exam average was a 70. But it's a great class and Dr. Young is amazing!", 
            "Professor Young explained all the material super clearly and the class wasn't hard at all. The article critiques are a little tricky just because they have very specific grading criteria, so make sure to go double check with her or the GSIs that what you're doing is what they're looking for.", 
            "If you do the readings, listen in lecture, and do the study guides for the exams, you'll do fine. Make sure to go to office hours for your four article critiques - they aren't hard, but they follow a very specific grading criteria and the GSIs are really helpful. The exams were a lot of writing, but came straight from the study guide and lectures.", 
            "One of the sweetest, most genuine professors I've had! She has a genuine interest in her subject matter & plenty of field experience to draw on for examples. So helpful & interested in her students! It's not 100% necessary to go to lecture, but the majority of lectures were so interesting & funny that I didn't want to miss! Highly recommended!!", 
            "Amazing woman. Prof. Young is one of the nicest people you will ever meet. She wants her students, and everyone she meets to do well and learn as they go. Drop into her office hours and talk to her, she will be warm, welcoming, and helpful with anything you ask, even if it is advice outside of class. She is a mom to her students.", 
            "Prof Lisa is really helpful - you can get a lot of tips just by visiting her office hours before exams/projects are due! Grading really depends on the GSI; getting an A requires a fair bit of work on the projects, but it's definitely not unreasonable.", 
            "Super nice lady! Didn't mind going to lecture but it could get a bit boring. Text book readings were not mandatory in my experience but you should at least skim through the articles she assigns. Grading isn't too bad but it really depends on the GSI you get. Exams are not hard, just study the review she sends out.", 
            "A very nice lady!! The class was rather boring and repetitive though but she and the GSI were willing to help.", 
            "She's a sweetheart! I really loved this class, it helped solidify my major in Anthropology. Even though the GSI grades harshly, the exams are nice, since she give you the short answer questions. This allows you to gather your thoughts. I really loved this class, and I always looked forward to going!", 
            "Great class. She's very knowledgable and interested in what she's teaching. She's very good at teaching in a way that anyone (not just anthropologists) could understand. Reading assignments aren't necessary but they're interesting. I learned a lot in this class and was actually excited to go to lecture.", 
            "She's an amazing professor! I never thought I'd be interested in archaeology but she made it really interesting. Also easy A, don't need to read the textbook at all. Just pay attention in class. The take home projects and exams are easy to get As in. I did both projects the night before and got full marks on one and 1 off full marks for the other.", 
            "Love this lady!!! she is so nice and willing to help you out. Exams are easy if you prepare for them using the study guide. Lectures can sometimes be boring but most of the are really interesting and fun. Discussions are boring and the Article Critiques SUCK because the GSIs grade so hard, but other than that, this is a great course.", 
            "TAKE THIS CLASS. The most fun class that Ive take at U of M. Im always at the edge of my seat when she is lecturing and she is so easy to talk to at office hours. If you can fit it, do it!!", 
            "Easy and fun.", 
            "Very nice and very helpful. Class is interesting and even sort of fun. If you go to class, do the readings (which are pretty easy and interesting), and have any writing ability, you're going to get an A. A rare interesting and easy class where you learn a good amount."

He was impassioned about the subject of grammarsomething that seems odd at first, but which made more sense as the class progressed: it actually is an interesting subject.", 
            "awesome!", 
            "I took Cureton's grammar class and then did an independent study back in 1997-1998. The work I did with him was lifechanging. He is the best professor I ever had. His temporal theory works. I still apply it in my thinking in many ways, not least of which in my practice as a lawyer. Thank you, Professor Cureton.", 
            "This guy is crazy, and it is entertaining.If you have a prior interest and understanding of poetry this course will interest you but if you don't then do not take it because you will have no idea what he talking about. It is based on his theory which is confusing; so even though attendance is not mandatory, go to class!", 
            "Believe what everyone has said. I wish I would have come here before I wrote my last paper. The papers are regurgitation, but his theories are ridiculous so you can't predict what he wants to hear. He seems disjointed with the world in general. Many profs on here are labeled \"avoid\" by kids who don't put in the effort. This one is a true MUST AVOID", 
            "Horrible. Avoid at all costs. All he does is rant and rave about his theories about poetry, which make absolutely no sense, and every class he seems to regurgitate the same ridiculous theories. Class attendance is utterly pointless.",

            "Worst professor I have ever had. While he is passionate about poetry, he only expresses his own opinions and theories that are incomprehensible to anyone but himself. He can hardly explain his theory to others, as it changes almost constantly. Absolutely horrible- take ANY other prof. He actually made me decide not to become an English teacher.", 
            "Professor Cureton is completely horrible. His theory is insane and in the papers thats all he wants you to talk about. If you can finally get what he wants though, the class is easy, basically use the coursepack and all the analysis he does for you beforehand. I /rarely/ came to class. He just drivels on about nothing. And he's kinda creepy. Avoid.", 
            "Cureton is not as bad as everyone says. He can be funny & his love of poetry is evident. The class IS based solely on his theory. Just go to class in the beginning & get the general idea. Take detailed notes on one specific poem so you can write a paper on it. This can be an easy A, just give him what he wants to hear. Class is not mandatory.",

This theory is completely absurd and if you tried to talk to people outside the class about poetry the way he expects people to talk about poetry, they'd look at you like you were crazy. I learned nothing useful here. Boring, totally pointless.",

            "one of the worst classes i have taken. rambles about his \"poetic paradigm\" but doesn't spend a lot of time analyzing individual poems in a valuable way. paper assigments are confusing. this will not help you understand poetry or gain a new perspetive on it. do yourself a favor and take a different professor.", 
            "His class is NOT helpful to the understanding of poetry. While he has some ideas that make some sense, he spends most of the time rambling in a very disjointed fashion about his concepts of \"THE POETICS\" and \"SENSIBILITIES.\" DO NOT take this class if you have any other options. he is nice, but you'll learn nothing coherent.",

Basically, his class is worthless and it will not make you enjoy poetry or even look at it in a new way. In office hours, he'll just ramble on, so dont' even bother.", 
            "His poetics can be difficult to understand, but if you can grasp the concepts, then your perspective of poetry will definitely be strengthened. He's very nice, willing to help, and passionate about poetry.",

Prof K allowed the class to be flexible according to her students' interests and current events while still providing a great foundation that lead up to our final paper (personal research). She has inspired me greatly to continue a career in academia. I can't recommend her enough.", 
            "I'm sad to see what people have written about Prof K. She teaches her theory because it is thorough and foundational. You don't have to write down much from the slides if you do the readings. If you are actually interested in IR and aren't just taking this as a blow-off, Prof K can be one of your greatest resources at U of M. Go to office hours!!!!", 
            "It pains me to rate Prof. Koremenos this low, because I think she's a good person and cares about her students. It isn't a hard class, but it was boring and the material was common sense to the point of dissuading me from taking another political science class. This was her first time teaching 160, though, so I hope it improves with time.", 
            "Professor Koremenos takes an extremely interesting topic almost unbearable. She teaches her own theories which takes away the objectivity of the material. Lectures are boring. She also goes through the slides too fast, and then she leaves out the important information on the ones she uploads online making it difficult to study effectively.", 
            "Professor Koremenos made one of my favorite subjects pretty boring. Lectures were very dry and repetitive and the grade was based mainly off small 10 question pop quizzes. Wouldn't recommend", 
            "Professor Koremenos is more concerned with her own attendance numbers than the success of her students. She doesn't post powerpoints to the student site, and goes through them far too quickly in lecture, preventing students from taking complete notes and making studying difficult. Large portions of grades are determined by pop quizzes.", 
            "Literally this is the most boring class I've ever been to. She drones on about obvious, common sense ideas that you don't even need to be taught. We literally just learned directly from the textbook and the only reason to go to lecture is because of the random pop quizzes given at the end of lecture that are stupid easy. This class waste of time", 
            "This was an excellent class and Prof. Koremenos is a very dedicated, intelligent Professor. I learned more in this class than I have in most others. A large part of our grade was a big term paper at the end of the semester, for which we conducted independent research. Prof. Koremenos helped me learned valuable research and writing skills.", 
            "The International Relations seminar section titled International Law: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It? with Barbara Koremenos was by far one of the best classes I've taken at Michigan. She cares deeply about her students and is more than willing to help if you take the initiative to go to office hours.", 
            "This class was very disorganized and unclear. I feel like it had so much lost potential. The professor was nice but the class was just so unstructured and based mostly on her own writings. I would definitely NOT recommend anyone to take it. The many group projects and quizzes were just confusing, plus there is a 15-page final paper.",

I don't know my grade and classes ended today...",

Her lectures are remarkably dull and her slides are seemingly put together by a 5 year old. I spent the entire semester trying to meet with her and it was like pulling teeth.

            "John Whittier-Ferguson's class has made me a better writer than any other English class I have ever taken, and I have had some really great English teachers before! Prior to this class, my writing was more unorganized and less detailed, and after this class, it was just on a much more advanced level. John is hardworking and efficient.", 
            "Great guy. Tough grader but really does give great feedback and is more than willing to help. Keeps lectures and readings entertaining and is truly passionate about his work. I would absolutely recommend taking his class if you are looking to improve your writing and reading skills.", 
            "John is absolutely brilliant, a total pleasure to be around, and is the only professor I have ever gone to office hours for on a regular basis. He is a tough grader, though, so don't be surprised when you get your first paper back with a C+ or a B-!", 
            "John is the best professor I've had during my studies as a Lit major at UM. Loves what he teaches and loves to teach it, and he's good at it! His classes, which require a fair amount of reading, have been some of the most rewarding I've ever had.", 
            "Had the most fun I've ever had in an English class with John this semester. Dude made Ulysses fun to read. That's no mean feat. Even Nabokov admitted that some parts of that monstrous book bored him to death. Be prepared for LOTS and LOTS and LOTS of reading tho.", 
            "No one better.", 
            "The most stimulating, informative, and rewarding class I've ever taken in my life. But be warned - it's not for the faint at heart! There's a lot of reading, and your writing WILL be pushed to the next level. Luckily, John is always there for his students with extra OH and instant email responses. If you're up for it, it is BEYOND worth it.", 
            "JWF is hands down my favorite professor at UM. He's super engaging in lectures and is great at facilitating class discussions. He truly values his students' contributions to the class. John's enthusiasm for literature is contagious and I worked my ass off for this class because I know it's worth it. Looking forward to my next class with him!", 
            "John is fantastic. He really cares about his students, and he's super willing to work with you when you need help. He's also really understanding that we all have 12 million other things going on and gladly gives extensions when you actually need one. Classes are stimulating because he allows the students to lead the discussion, wherever it may go.", 
            "John is the best prof of English I have ever taken. He's incredibly dedicated, and he's also one of the nicest guys you'll meet. Any foible John has (if there are any) is frankly negligible because he does so much for his students. Don't take his class if you aren't prepared for rigor though. If you are ready, expect an incredibly rewarding time.", 
            "JWF is the man. His lectures are dynamic and interesting - he hardly lectures, actually. Class is very discussion driven. He is insightful and encouraging of students. The assignments are difficult, but you get a chance to rewrite for a grade. Poetry has never been so much fun.", 
            "John is one of the most dedicated, passionate professors I have ever had. He is always willing to meet up with students to discuss papers/ ideas/ etc! While his class is not an easy A, I guarantee he will make you a better writer. Definitely worth taking any class with him!", 
            "John was an AMAZING teacher. beyond knowledgable on subject matter and ALWAYS willing to help each student. He is always available for extra help, and will make time for each student. he creates a comfortable and encouraging atmosphere in which each student's ideas are appreciated and praised. he makes you want to participate and learn!", 
            "JWF is the most encouraging professor I have ever worked with. He pushes you and makes you better through sheer support and excitement. Passionate, brilliant, engaged, and so fun - you will never regret the dedication his classes require. His Joyce class blew my mind every day and changed how I read. So worth everything, Don't hesitate.", 
            "It is impossible to understate what a phenomenal professor John is. He is incredibly positive and conducts some of the most meaningful class discussions I've ever had. He can make any comment you say sound like an epiphany. No other professor could you e-mail at 11 pm and get a response on your paper question, with in-text comments, in 15 minutes.", 
            "This man is a genius. He is the most enthusiastic, engaged, invested, nurturing, and excited professor I have ever met. He will make you better. He will listen. He will inspire and delight. He grades with lightning speed, will answer any question, will hear any point and help you improve it. He was meant to be an educator. Take his class.", 
            "If you've graduated without a JWF class on your transcript--go back.", 
            "John is a phenomenal educator--unquestionably the best professor that I've had in my college career. He devotes an amazing amount of time, energy, and care to helping his students develop their projects and their general literary analysis skills. He takes a genuine interest in his students and does his best to cultivate the very in them.", 
            "John was a fantastic teacher. So passionate about the material, I couldn't help but get excited about it too. Really cared about our understanding of the material, encouraged everyone to participate, made sure we understood everything, by providing extra office hours, extra meetings to discuss the poetry, etc. The best professor I've had at UMich.", 
            "I want to talk to him for forever; his positive attitude is infectious. I learned a great deal in this class, certainly, but I think I grew a great deal as well. There was a lot of work and a lot of thinking but it always felt worthwhile."

Overall, tests are easy if you find Mastering Astronomy Questions online, and homework and labs are easy but annoying. If you try a bit you will get an A easily.", 
            "Aller was pretty boring and I had to force myself to pay attention. You need to read on your own to do well. But the subject matter can be interesting, and it's not that hard of a class if you do some work. Attendence isnt mandatory but you need to go because of iclicker questions", 
            "Professor Aller is a great guy and definitely knows what he's talking about! However, he's getting a bit old so he tends to get really excited and goes off topic a lot. I recommend definitely reading the assigned chapters. Though attendance is not mandatory to lecture I REALLY RECOMMEND going b/c clicker questions count for grades and are helpful.", 
            "Terrible lecturer. Only reason I'm coming to class is because of those iclicker questions. Very easy material just need a better teacher to make going to class worth going to.", 
            "I did other homework in class, and didn't listen at all. I then read the textbook before each midterm (non-cumulative), and did great. The people who fail are those who enroll in 102 and expect a class with no work.", 
            "Do not take this class for NS or QR credit if you aren't really interested in astro. The professors were incredibly vague, unclear in their grading criteria, and honestly just boring. The tests were impossible and had little to do with what we studied in labs. I did all the homework, went to every class, and will probably still fail. Awful.", 
            "Never really went to class because it was extremely boring, but had to read the textbook a ton.", 
            "Aller and Ridgestone are incredibly vague and difficult to understand. Plus, the workload for this class is too much for an intro class. Exams are difficult and the professors don't provide you with any practice problems or anythign of that nature. Look elsewhere for NS credit", 
            "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS AS A BLOW OFF. Actually do not take Astronomy classes in general for you NS requirement, unless you are actually very interested. Poor teaching, boring, and way harder than you expect it to be.", 
            "This guy is the man. This class is so easy. I literally googled every question for the online hw. I didn't open up the textbook at all and got an A. Take this class if you want an easy A and if you want to party hard with Hugh.", 
            "Professor Aller is extremely boring and almost never stays on topic. Lecture slides contain errors, don't cover all the material, and are never uploaded on time. Read the book and do the homework, but going to class isn't really necessary.", 
            "He may be a good astronomer and researcher, but he's a really mediocre instructor. He spends most of class time talking about his history with astronomy, rarely about astronomy itself. He is unclear, has very little interest in teaching. There is no usable textbook with him. Thankfully most of the homework could've been answered using the internet.", 
            "Didn't learn a single thing from him. Had a few homework assignments that could only be done by searching the internet since there's no text. Luckily there were also no exams. He's hard to follow during lectures and very boring. By the end of the semester, we ended up just spending class time counting how much he said \"essentially\" and \"actually.\"", 
            "Dr. Aller obviously loves astronomy, but he should not be teaching it. He doesn't cover test material in lectures and goes off on tangents about other aspects of astronomy that have no relation to what's being learned in class. Read the book, and you should be fine.", 
            "Prof. Aller is probably one of the most adorable old men ever. Very grandfatherly and sweet. However, he does tend to go on about \"the olden days\" at the expense of class material. He also breezes through complicated and important info. Read the textbook and you'll be golden, though! Easy class.", 
            "Professor Aller is like a nice grandfather figure. He is very friendly and does his best to be helpful and is full of interesting stories. That said, his lectures are kind of hard to follow since he isn't the greatest public speaker. He often goes off on tangents and excludes information from his lecture slides.", 
            "Aller is incredibly nice and helpful but his lectures tend to involve a large amount of stories that don't really have anything to do with the material. Many of the notes he covers are not on powerpoint slides which makes it so you end up leaving lecture with little or no notes taken.",

His lectures are good and helpful but discussion section is where you actually learn how to do the stuff that'll be tested on. Tests are much more quantitative than lectures. Read the textbook, it helps", 
            "Professor Dudley makes the concepts interesting, but his Econ 101 course is not quantitative enough to properly prepare students for Econ 401. The only homework assignments are papers which are then peer-reviewed, and they don't require much quantitative analysis. But he does make himself available to students and his lectures are quite humorous.", 
            "I enjoyed Dudley's class. He is a good professor, especially because this topic is really his speciality. My only complaint is that sometimes lectures were just boring.", 
            "Would not have made it through Econ 101 if Dudley had not been my professor. Super detailed yet entertaining lectures. Very respectable professor who genuinely cares about his students. Grading system is fair.", 
            "Awesome professor, accessible and fair grading system", 
            "I'm writing this to recommend Econ 370 class! One of the best professors! His lectures are clear and interesting. But I hope he gives more questions in the exam, because each question worth too much! So if you make a mistake, it affects a lot. It's basically whether you don't make a mistake or not.", 
            "Dudley's a really nice guy and probably the easiest Econ 101 professor. His class is very manageable if you either go to class or watch the online recordings of class, but a bit difficult if you don't do that. The textbook isn't necessary, but it can help. He also drops your lowest test grade, which helps a ton.", 
            "Genuinely cares about his students. Him and Professor Adams were easily my favorites in the department. Made the regrettable mistake of going to my GSI's office hours instead of his.", 
            "Dr. Dudley is a great choice for any economics classes. His lectures are clear and he is great at answering any questions. He also gives great real-life examples to make sure you understand the material. Exams were not difficult because there were many sources to prepare well. Take econ 101 with Dudley.", 
            "Dudley is a good choice for your econ professor. He does not assign any homework besides 5 400-500 word essays that are peer reviewed before submission. My only criticism is his tests are a lot harder than his lectures. The tests are a lot of math so you have to go to your discussions to learn how to do it. Besides the tests it was very easy.", 
            "I loved Dudley!! I honestly don't know why everything thinks Caldwell is the best - Dudley is just as great in my opinion. He is fun and interesting to listen to, and he's passionate about econ. Tests were much harder than lectures though (lots of application and math I didn't expect before I saw the first exam) so go to office hours/discussion.",

            "- posts lectures online - class is straight forward. Materials are all in the text book - 3 midterms (lowest is dropped) 1 final - relatively easy course as long as you put in the effort", 
            "He is the only teacher I've ever had that actually makes me excited to learn economics (weird, right?). Not only does he make the class as easy as possible, but I would marry him if he wasn't already married.", 
            "Dudley is one of the best professors I've had at the University of Michigan. He is super enthusiastic about economics and wants his students to succeed. Tests are fair; he does not test anything not covered in lecture. Workload was light, but you learn a lot. He is also generous enough to offer extra credit; 55% of the class got an A this semester!", 
            "I was shocked to see he only had a 4 on here. His enthusiasm for economics is contagious, explanations of concepts are really insightful, and his expectations more than reasonable. The tests are also straightforward and overall the workload was very light compared to other 4 credit classes. I have solidified economics as a major because of Dudley.", 
            "Lecture with Dudley was not helpful in the slightest as he just read off the slides and would end up stuck on one small detail for 30 minutes. As others have said he recently changed the format of the class, and the new essays have nothing to do with exams. Tests are way harder than problems done in class and often are worded to trip you up. Pass.", 
            "Lecture is pointless he just reads off the slides and rambles. You'e better off just reading the book. The assignments have barely any correlation to the exams so they don't help, and from my experience and my friends' the GSIs don't really care of want to be there. Literally just wait for a spot in Caldwell's class.", 
            "The lecture and discussions are very concept based however, when you get to the exams it is all math problems. The lectures are not helpful.", 
            "Dudley is a really good professor. He is very excited about Econ and his lectures are really good. For 101, the grading is fair. You take 4 exams but can drop 1 of 3 and write 5 short papers."

Homework overly difficult to downright confusing and doesn't help you understand the material, extensive office hours required. If you do not learn this way, too bad, so sad.",

            "He is good at explaining the material, especially out of class. Will take the time to make sure you understand the concepts. Be ready to write quickly in class and then process the info later. His exams are pretty fair.",

You can tell he cares about the subject and understands it completely. He is also the best at responding to questions, you can tell he makes sure he understands them fully before responding. Would take any of his classes.",

He teaches VERY theoretically, which it good for understanding the foundations of the material, but not so great for actually working through examples. Going to discussion sections was imperative for my success as we went through examples there. Heavy workload.", 
            "He is a good lecturer and posts the notes online after class. He writes really quickly which can be difficult but is necessary since there is so much to cover. He is extremely helpful in office hours because he helps you think your way to the correct answer.", 
            "Achilleas (or AA if you prefer) was an amazing professor for 216. Puts a ton of energy into his lectures, enthusiastic about the class, very knowledgeable. Homework is tough, but fair. You really learn the material. 10/10 would take another class with him.", 
            "Liked to move at a fast pace during lectures. Board handwriting is terrible. Did not separate important material from long proofs that had little importance in the long run. Good intentions, but had mentality that it was always the student at fault for not understanding rather than him not explaining it well. Makes sporadically hilarious comments.", 
            "He verbally clear. But his writing on the board is horrid. Sometimes it's difficult his writing is so poor; it's time consuming to understand. His midterms are frustrating. You can study all the material as much as you want, but he'll found some other material that he \"mentions\" in class. He doesn't accept any formulas derived outside of class", 
            "Anastasopoulos was a great professor for 216. Workload was very fair for the class (historically it can be extremely heavy). If you devote roughly 10 hours a week to this class outside of lecture, you should be fine. Labs are fun, although some prelabs may be tough. Exams may be a bit tricky at times but are very fair.",

            "He's truly kind and willing to help. But the homework assigned doesn't have much to do with what he taught in class, which needs us learn much more in spare time. And the tests are also of a totally different style with homework.", 
            "Prof. Anastasopoulos is one of the best professors I have had at Michigan. The material can be difficult, but he explains everything in the clearest, most intuitive way possible. Just go to class, do all of the HWs, and DO EXTRA PRACTICE PROBLEMS FROM THE BOOK. The class really is not that hard if you practice a lot.", 
            "I liked Prof. Anastasopoulos. EECS 401 is definitely a hard class and one of the many roadblocks in the BSEE degree. However, he explained complex topics in fluid ways, understanding that the concepts are hard to understand for students. He also held almost daily office hours, and even more near exams.",

Is equally patient in office hours as well. as for his greek accent, its not hard to understand at all, and is actually really cool! Cool prof, I would recommend 401 with him.

            "This professor was very lost. You might not notice it at first but she says \"right?\" a lot because even she's not sure of the information she's presenting. Horrible lecturer altogether. If you do take her, just make sure that you read the book, not her slides. Be careful because the class is split by 2 professors with 2 completely different styles.", 
            "Chang is quite literally the worst professor EVER. She is completely unclear during lecture and when someone asks a question she either doesn't know the answer or responds with an answer that leaves us all more confused than we were at the start. She took my interest for bio and ripped it to shreds. AVOID HER", 
            "Worst professor ever. She crams in all of the most complicated concepts into the lecture that is 2 days before the exam, is not sure of herself and can be extremely boring. Her exams are pretty hard, but she sometimes throws in some easy questions in the short answer, but avoid if possible.", 
            "Amy Chang is probably the worst professor I have had. She was very confusing in lecture and students usually corrected her. Her exams had poor clarity as well and were not very representative of what she taught us. Avoid her if you can.", 
            "Amy Chang is the worst professor I have had at Michigan. Her tests are inconsistent with what she emphasizes in lectures, she is horrible at giving explanations, and when she answers questions (which she usually doesn't) the answers a re not even relevant. Do yourself a favor and AVOID THIS PROFESSOR.",

            "Professor Chang is not the most engaging lecturer, but her slides are very complete. I didn't get much from lecture, but I studied the slides before tests and did okay. Her tests basically require you memorize the material completely. Not a great or terrible professor, I still enjoyed the class.", 
            "Heard a lot of complaints about her going into he class so I expected the worst. Would not say that she was the best lecturer but she would say the same thing five times so it did star to sink in after a while. Exam questions were vague and tricky.", 
            "Dr. Chang is the worst lecturer I have had at UM. She will make you dread going to chemistry lecture. Her iClickers are an embarrassment because she usually cannot explain why her answer is more correct than the others. The exams are quite similar. While it is possible to do well on them, I would avoid her if possible.", 
            "Worst professor I've had so far. She says the word 'right' every two seconds and never seems to know what she is talking about. Reading the book is not entirely mandatory but it gives a much better understanding of the materials she covers. Avoid this class if possible."

            "Prof. Meerkov gives us a great introduction of nonlinear systems and control. I love his unique opinions on some lecture contents which you may not be able to get from textbook.", 
            "In lectures he would always explain why the theory was important and give brief historical overviews of who developed it. Could tell he was really passionate about the field. Only criticism was he didn't do a great job of time management, but it was the first time teaching the class in a while. So I'm sure this will be better in the future.", 
            "Great professor - interesting lectures and very knowledgeable and respected in the field. Highly recommend nonlinear systems with Prof Meerkov.", 
            "A great teacher with his own teaching style. Actually nonlinear system is a really tough topic but he can give you a clear picture of the whole thing. Just follow his step you will get a good score.", 
            "EECS 562 was the best class I took at University of Michigan and I really enjoyed studying the course under Prof. Meerkov. His method of teaching is very nice, he writes all the notes on the board and you get very good notes. Try not to miss the class, because in every class you learn a lot .", 
            "I can't advise enough that students interested in the field of control take Prof. Meerkov's EECS 460 course. Like the mathematics in control, Prof. Meerkov appreciates rigor. He stresses understanding the underlying mathematical concepts in control, and how they're connected. But more so, he provides a look at practical control, not just theory.", 
            "Honestly one of the best professors I have had at UMICH. He is a pioneer in his field and his passion in his work is reflected during his lectures. He is approachable during office hours, funny during lectures, and extremely knowledgeable in his field of study.", 
            "In general, Prof. Meerkov is a great teacher and explains everything clearly and with patience. HWs and exams are not difficult and are helpful to learn the course better. You can easily get A or A+ if you do the HWs carefully. The course is also a very good course, although I expected to learn more control rather than systems.", 
            "I took Nonlinear Systems (AERO 551/EECS 562) from Dr. Meerkov. The class material is very rigorous--unless you have a math background it'll be one of the toughest courses you'll ever take. But Dr. Meerkov was solid, clear, organized, and straightforward. Don't be late to class, ask him for help during office hours, and life will be good.", 
            "The topic itself is hard, but Professor Meerkov did his best to help his students to learn. His lectures are well organized and clear about definitions.", 
            "Entertaining lectures. Homework sets were fair (in terms of difficulty and amount). Exam material was a good challenge, but enough time was provided on the exam to spend time on each question.", 
            "A very helpful class and very good teacher. His teaching style is unique, he is always well prepared for the class and manages the class time very well.", 
            "The lecture is very clear on concepts, and give easy to understand example.", 
            "For Non Linear Systems Theory and Control - Prof. Meerkov has a ton of experience in this arena which makes the class all the more significant. I enjoyed his side explanations of the history of this field. The homework was assigned consistently and did take time to complete. Make sure to learn theorems covered in class, exam is largely conceptual.", 
            "He's is a great Prof. , has lot of knowledge about the subject. The course is difficult, but at the end its all worth it.", 
            "A lot of the kids in the class took the class overseas or in other departments prior to 460. Hence, having a mediocre professor benefits them over students who are seeing this material for the first time. Lectures are unclear. I would look at my notes after copying them exactly from the board and they were incoherent. Homework and tests are rough.", 
            "It seemed like a lot of lecture was just copying things out of the book, which is a MUST have. The grade breakdown was 20/40/40 for homework and two exams, so there's a lot of pressure on the tests (which were way too definition-heavy in my opinion.) Overall I feel like I learned more from the book than I did from lectures.", 
            "Professor Meerkov was the worst professor I have had thus far at Michigan. He was disrespectful to students, his lectures were unclear and disorganized, and the homework did not reflect what was \"taught\" in class. I walked in expecting to enjoy the class but walked out learning next to nothing and losing some interest in controls", 
            "I really liked Prof Meerkov and his lectures. However, I found him to not be particularly helpful when most people asked him questions. His lectures are very clear, but aren't enough to do the homework and lab. Yes, there's a lab (simulation). Ended up being a rather poor class for me. While I learned a lot of analysis tools, no design."

Definitely a great choice for ULWR.",

See her teaching? Take it with this amazing person! Spent a long time writing those writing assignments (probably like 8 hours) but I got 100s on two of them. Get writing!", 
            "Lectures are boring but she's fun. Didn't use the textbook other than for terms. 1 midterm, 1 final, 4 average length papers (3-5 pgs for two and 5-7 pgs for the other two). Exams were MC (typical psych ?s). Lectures are optional, but 4% EC (w/ 2 passes) SO GO. Discussions mandatory (w/ 2 passes). Grade depends on GSI. Show your trying/improving.", 
            "One of my favorite professors at the University. She is so nice and really knows what she is talking about. The assignments were all fair, well graded, and helped us learn the material. If you are a psych major (or any major really) you should take this class. You are going to get a lot out of it", 
            "Probably one of my favorite courses as an undergrad. Professor Seifert is a very kind and sweet-hearted woman who will go out of her way to make sure students are actually learning the material and using it to excel in their lives. She will take the time to remember all the students names as well. Go to class, put in the work, and you will do well.", 
            "Other than being slightly vague with how she grades classwork (it's entirely subjective) the class was surprisingly more interesting than I would've assumed. Don't be afraid to ask her why you received a certain grade if you don't agree because she is very fair with discussion. Her sense of humor is a little dry but it made the class fun.", 
            "Great professor! Easy to get an A. If you throw yourself out, ask her questions. Very very approachable. Plus, the material is interesting and can be applied for any major, not to mention life itself.",

            "Great class! \"Easy A,\" they say, but you do have to engage yourself enough to figure out what Dr. Seifert is looking for on exams, at least. Practice exams are very helpful. I didn't buy the book, but used the library's copies here & there for exam study. Discussion section was actually the best for any class I've taken yet at UM. TAKE THIS CLASS!!", 
            "Best Professor ever - she's so nice and just hilarious! And seriously, easy A class. By easy A, I mean READ the readings, GO to discussion and DO the work (which really isn't even that much). If you do that, you WILL get an A. Note on exams - easy, easy, easy. She gives you a study guide which basically is the exam.",

From hearing my friends thoughts on other Psych 111 classes, I think Dr, Seifert is by far the best. You do need to do some reading and attend discussion to get an A and all lectures are posted online.",

If you read the textbook and follow the list of terms that she posts as a guideline, you will do very well on the exams. She also gives out a ton of extra credit!",

If you reach out to her for office hours she will get to know you and take personal interest. 3 Tests, 50 mc and potential for 5 extra credit points for each exam. I loved her and hope to have her again in the future.",

Sometimes she skips stuff in lecture, and you won't know unless you read the book. Exams are pretty decent if you go over notes and ask lots of questions. Highly recommend!",

Definitely be prepared to read for this class.",

I would strongly recommend setting a couple hours aside of the weekend for that weeks readings. The test material comes more from readings than lecture slides.", 
            "Luis means well and is a nice dude. His lectures were kind of boring and he often went on personal tangents. The class had three online exams, timed with one book anthology. The exams weren't that hard, but definitely don't go into them without going over reading and lectures or you won't do good. While he's a nice guy, I would not recommend.",

I came to the boring lectures, took notes, did the readings, but still wasn't prepared at all for the exams. They had questions from optional readings, were opinion-based, and some just had wrong answers. Extra-Credit saved my grade.",

The thing I dislike the most about his classes are that he lectures off of PowerPoints, but then goes on huge rants that do not relate to the content. He also gives out a lot of reading.

The workshop in class ends up being rather cruel though, and doesn't lend to experimenting with your work. Criticism ends up that this needs to be more descriptive or detailed, this character needs more of a role.",

That said, she is rude and sometimes cruel. She will correct your oral grammar and call you a moron in front of your peers. She breeds a hostile and vindictive workshop.", 
            "I love Tish...she helped me improve my writing and her comments were extremely helpful. She doesn't sugar-coat things, she tells it like it is. That's why she's so respectable... and she's funny as hell.",

            "Tish is one-of-a-kind. She's blunt, but if you can handle her constructive criticism, she will take you from a decent writer to someone who can really turn a sentence. She'll make sure your grammar is up to par, too (comma of address, anyone?). I sincerely miss her guidance and wish I were still her student."

            "Orgo is very difficult, in general, but Dr. Nolta will show you your way through the material. She makes lectures understandable, her office hours are sooo helpful! GO TO THEM (coursepack solutions!) Her exams are \"tough,\" but they are really just comprehensive and wanting to know if you can do the material inside and out.", 
            "I've heard that in previous semesters the chem 216 lab has been difficult and time consuming but Nolta made going to lab every week a very pleasant experience.", 
            "Dr. Nolta is one of the best professors I have taken here at umich. She cares so much and her lectures are truly an experience that I wont forget. Her extra OH (which she doesnt have to do but still does) are amazing and I recommend going to them. Introduce yourself to her, you wont regret it.", 
            "The best", 
            "Nolta made the most difficult class of my life very enjoyable. She really wants everyone to do well, and cares about each student even though she teaches hundreds. She gives out gifts at the end of the year and writes very clear and beautiful notes!", 
            "Dr. Nolta is the best! Great at explaining topics, cool lady, quickly responds to emails, office hours podcasted, completes the coursepack with you, has like 10 practice exams for each exam. She teaches concepts and reasoning skills, as well as how to do problems. With the expanded grading scale, there's no excuse to get lower than a B- (60%)", 
            "Honestly the greatest professor I have ever had. Her lectures given teach you the very basics, and she details everything in her office hours. She even does the coursepack with you, making it so much more useful for studying. Her exams can be difficult, but she provides all of her past exams as practice. Hard work will reward you in this class.", 
            "I have never had a professor pour themselves into teaching as much as Nolta. She truly cares about her students and goes above and beyond to provide them with helpful resources. If you have the opportunity, you MUST take orgo with her. She makes the class manageable and inspires you to work hard.", 
            "She's an amazing person. I never got to know her personally and I wish I did. I've never been a great chem person, but the way she teaches makes it impossible to not understand. The exams ARE hard because of how great she teaches, but I would say its worth it without a doubt.", 
            "Nolta is known to be a great professor. I agree, but there are faults. For example, I feel her lectures/notes are too unorganized/weirdly ordered. So that wasn't the best thing ever. However, I loved her workshops, especially the fact she actually gives coursepack answers before Exams (unlike other profs).", 
            "Probably one of the best professors (if not the best) I've had so far in college. Definitely take your lecture with her if you can! Excellent lecturer and genuinely cares about her students.", 
            "If you have to take orgo, definitely go with nolta. Any problems I had with this class and her lecture were with the chem dept. making this class so damn hard. She's adorable and will give you stuffed animals and candy. Tips for success: watch office hour podcasts and use her website for extra practice tests. Do them ALL.", 
            "Dr. Nolta is definitely the best professor at U of M! I came into orgo terrified and not knowing what to expect but Dr. Nolta has made orgo one of the best classes that I have ever taken. Dr. Nolta truly cares about every single one of her students and her dedication shows. Go to her office hours, workshops, and lectures and you can succeed in orgo",

            "Podcasts all her office hours and weekly workshops. Genuinely cares that all her students do well, hard exams but definitely the most AMAZING professor I've had a UofM. If you're taking orgo you have to take it with Nolta.", 
            "She is the best professor I have ever had. If you have to take ORGO, do everything you can to get her.", 
            "She's by far the best professor I've ever had. Wasn't originally gonna take Orgo in the winter but I'm so glad I did, she's such a gem. It's a hard class but if you go to her office hours/workshops/go-aheads you'll be fine. You can tell she really cares about her students", 
            "Probably the best professor I'll ever have at Michigan. I've never been so interested in a chemistry class before (and usually I hate them). Would 100% recommend taking a class with her. She's so understanding, helpful, and intelligent. The definition of what a professor should be."

            "I quite literally have never learned less in a class in my entire life. If you do well by learning things on your own without any help from a teacher, this class is for you. She is funny, but I often times found her being very rude to me for not understanding what we are doing. Ive learned so little Im considering retaking the class over the summer", 
            "Read the book and you'll do great in her class. Her lectures are brief and she teaches more by letting you do examples. She is sarcastic, but it makes class enjoyable. Very detail oriented.", 
            "Irina is awesome. She explains everything so well, gives a lot of extra practice problems and review sheets for exams. She can also be pretty funny from time to time. Calc 2 is hard but if you go to her class and study hard, you can do well", 
            "Irina is great, she is so helpful and her approach through in class problems is very helpful. Her accent is hard in the beginning, but easy to pick up on. She really wants to kids to do well and cracks jokes often. Calc 2 can be dry, but she does her best. You'll also quickly find yourself saying \"is it right?\" every lecture with her.", 
            "Calc 2 isn't that hard if you take the class with her. She is very willing to help her students out. She seems happy and enjoys it when students ask her questions. Although she has accent, her explanations are always pretty clear. Take her, it wouldn't be a bad choice.", 
            "Calc 2 is a hard class no matter which professor you take it with, but Irinia made it a lot more enjoyable. She clearly explained all concepts and really encourages students. She is always willing to help and really wants her students to do well. She also is funny, which made calc 2 less of a drag!", 
            "Irina is a very good professor. She has a strong accent and moves SO FAST through the material in class so I just rapidly copy down notes, but when I look over them later they make sense. She gives lots of practice problems in class, really helpful review sheets before exams, and is a great help during office hours!! Also, she's funny!", 
            "Calc 2 is a hard and fast course but Irina does her best to make sure the class understands all of the material. She is always willing to help on an individual level, all you need to do is ask. She can be humorous at times and she does have an accent, but you pick up on it easily.", 
            "Great, great calc teacher. She grades quizzes hard, but it doesn't matter cause they don't count toward your grade. Her classes always do really well, she's always ready to help. And she's been doing this for so long that she has teaching down to a science. If you show up and pay attention, you can do well.", 
            "Although calc 2 was one of the most difficult and stressful classes i have ever taken, Irina was incredible. She is so willing to help outside of class and has a great sense of humor. Definitely one of the best teachers you can get for such a horrible class.", 
            "Easily the best math teacher at U of M. She is more than willing to help on an individual level, all you have to do is ask, which may be semi-difficult as she is slightly intimidating. Completely understands the material. Doesn't take any b/s, for example, if you go to her office hours, she won't let you use a calculator. Smart & Russian.", 
            "She is nice, helpful. Works hard in class (i.e. works hard before class also). Always willing to helpful- she has nothing to do with the hard calc-2 exams. She doesn't write the exams- don't mess her quality with the hardness level of calc 2 exams.", 
            "does a lot of questions in class - but you have to read before class to get something out of it. very patient when she explains stuff.", 
            "Although it's rather difficult to understand her at time, Irina really knows the material and wants her students to do well. It takes some time getting used to her, but once I did, everything went well. Quizzes are good practice and are not figured into course grade. Use her as much as possible, do old exams, and you should be fine.", 
            "although her accent can be an issue at times, she's a great teacher and tries very hard. Her section isn't the easiest, but our exam scores as a section were 10% higher than other sections. This class is hard, but if you work at it, you'll be rewarded.", 
            "Let's get ready to struggle! Irina is useless in the purest sense of the word. She barely speaks English, She goes over entire sections of material in roughly 4 minutes, and then jumps directly to the difficult problems. She expects 5 copies of each team homework, and is extremely strict. Each day that I leave class, I feel dumber.", 
            "Irina is a nice lady, but not the type of teacher who was good for me. At the beginning of class she would dive right into the hard problems. It was good for the kids who had AP calc BC and for the kid who already took calc III, but I needed it to be a little slower. Irina is probably the best bet for calc II though. Get ready to struggle.", 
            "She really cares about and enjoys math. The focus is much more about students crunching problems than about her doing them on the board. A nice hands-on math class. Great for me, but maybe not for everyone.", 
            "Irina is a great lady. Calc 2 is a tough class, but she is willing to help as much as possible. She is really good and excited about helping with the homework questions. I would recommend Irina if you're taking calc 2."

He teaches about an extremely controversial topic and does so objectively and fairly, and despite having a background on the Israeli-Arab conflict going into the class, I learned so much from him.", 
            "Lieberman is a great professor. Lectures can be filled with a ton of information. He manages to present both sides very fairly.", 
            "So as long as you get the notes, lectures aren't mandatory. They're really great though! You can get by without the readings as long as you pay attention in section. You're graded on two exams and participation in your section so study up on the terms he gives you. He holds open office hours every week which is nice if you're confused at all.", 
            "Absolutely phenomenal teacher and an incredible course. His inspiration really got me interested in the conflict and has made me passionate about the subject. A great guy with so much information, it's phenomenal. He talks fast but try to listen instead of being obsessed with taking specific notes. Must take", 
            "Take any class Lieberman teaches. He is a kind man with genuine interest in what he teaches. The Arab-Israeli Conflict is not something it's easy to master, but when he teaches it, it's easy to understand and interesting. Lecture is not technically mandatory, but I'd go and listen to his genius. Loved this class.", 
            "Lieberman was a good lecturer. He would was aware if he was going too fast and allowed us to use laptops for notes. He would also stop to let us ask questions. He's easy to understand. If you're taking this class DO NOT BUY THE BOOKS. My GSI never talked about them and he kept telling us they were optional. Interesting and informative class!", 
            "Lieberman is an amazing professor! This was the best class I have taken at U-M. I always looked forward to going to lecture, and was impressed by Lieberman's ability to always provide all sides of the narrative with such a controversial topic. He is very responsive to email, and is always willing to answer any questions on that students have.", 
            "Lieberman is a phenomenal prof and gives so much information - you're going to be taken note the entire lecture, but you learn a lot. As long as you go to lecture you'll do fine, you don't need to do the reading (he even cut it down). Only issue - lecture is huge and little discussion. If you like small lectures/classes this may not be for you.", 
            "Really depends on your GSI, I had a great experience. Textbooks aren't totally necessary, I skimmed the readings and read what I was interested in. Most of the grade is just the final and midterm. If you go to the lectures and take notes, you'll be absolutely fine, and he's a good lecturer so doing so is not a chore.", 
            "The lectures can be tiring. Not because they are boring or because Lieberman isnt interesting, you just are taking pages of notes per lecture. I got an A+ in this course and i never did the reading. key to success is to take good notes and utilize the study guides given before the exams. Lieberman is hands down the best prof at U of M in my opinion", 
            "YOU DON'T NEED PRIOR INFO TO THE CONFLICT TO TAKE THIS CLASS! Don't be discouraged; I had no clue what Hamas or the Gaza Strip was(which is kinda sad). I just went to every lecture, typed really good notes, and studied hard for the midterm and final and got an A. I HIGHLY recommend the class. It kind of can depend on your GSI though.", 
            "Professor Lieberman is incredibly intelligent. If you take this class, I recommend typing your notes. He moves quickly and gives tons of information. Attendance is not taken, but I went to every single lecture. If you go to each class, you don't really need the textbooks. I didn't use mine and I did well. TAKE THIS CLASS. You'll learn so much.", 
            "One of the best classes you will ever take. He manages to be very fair and neutral, despite the fact that the Arab-Israel conflict is so complicated and emotionally-driven. He is very open to talking to students, and is known for taking some Muslim and Jewish students out to coffee and lunch. Truly an incredible class.", 
            "Truly an amazing lecturer; approaches the Arab-Israeli conflict from both sides with fairness and clear and compelling narratives. Gives an enormous amount of information in every lecture and clearly weaves it into the history of the conflict as a whole. I'd recommend this course to anyone interested at all in history. Plain and simple, a legend.", 
            "If you're used to discussion-type classes with small enrollment, do not take this class. Professor Lieberman is extremely smart and well informed, but his lecture style will get old and boring really quickly if you prefer discussion and engagement with the professor. It's not that hard to get a good grade in the class, but going to class is tough.", 
            "I can hardly put into words how incredible Professor Lieberman and this class are. I look forward to it every Tuesday and Thursday. He is probably the most intelligent person I've met and he pours knowledge into every person who walks into his class. If you have even one semester left at Umich, TAKE THIS CLASS! It is unbelievably amazing.", 
            "He's an awesome guy. Probably loved History because of him during freshman year. Just talk to him and learn as many things as you can.", 
            "This has been one of my favorite courses. Lieberman is incredibly smart and presents all of the information in a clear, understandable way. The class is challenging but compelling. 2 big tests and 1 optional paper. You will be typing throughout the entire lecture but he presents the material in a narrative that is easy to understand.", 
            "This class was amazing. Everyone should take this class. It is so interesting and you will learn so much from Professor Lieberman. The class is so thought-provoking and just genuinely interesting. Going to class was not mandatory but I always wanted to go because his lectures were so great. Exams were easy as long as you studied notes or the book.", 
            "I took this class when I already knew too much about Arab-Israeli conflict. I skipped most of the readings because I didn't have time. However, I never skipped his lectures. One of the best lecturers I have ever seen. He is very knowledgeable about the subject + can answer any question you ask. Beware, could be a tough one if you have no prior info"

I don't know why I kept going. Then the one paper that the grade was based on had 0 criteria laid out. No examples or anything. I had no idea what I was doing and paid the price.", 
            "Phenomenal lecturer. Lectures are two hours, so it takes stamina, but if you engage yourself it is completely worth it. Lectures blew my mind every day and although the readings could be long, I usually enjoyed them. It was a minicourse, so you get out of it what you put in, and it was worth it to put in a lot.",

I never post on online sites, but felt the need to convey how great of a lecturer Professor Amrine is.", 
            "TAKE THIS CLASS. You will have a better understanding of humanity. Amrine is incredibly intelligent and really helpful. His lectures are full of interesting notes on history, science, music, art, religion, etc. Lots of reading, but it's manageable and worth it.", 
            "Great professor. Very good to talk to during office hours. He speaks with a passion that is hard to find in a lot of professors. Lectures often don't relate to the books but still are very interesting to those concerned with German culture. If you have the chance take a class with this professor. it will be a good experience.",

This is the kind of class that was meant to be experienced while in college. He makes you actually think, not just memorize information.", 
            "Really smart and really passionate about the subject, but he didn't really discuss the novels we read as much as I would've hoped. The lectures were interesting but was mildly related to the text itself. The final exam was quite fair. He is extremely helpful, especially in office hours.", 
            "Very intelligent professor with awesome things to say. I wish he would have focused more on the texts, which were quite difficult. Lectures were only somewhat related to the texts.", 
            "One of the most joyful professors I have ever had. He obviously teaches because that is what he loves doing. He never makes you feel pressured to learn, but rather just makes all sort of information available to you, and what you choose to do with it is really up to you. Highly, highly recommended!", 
            "Listening to Prof. Amrine is dumbfounding--he's so passionate and knowledgeable about what he teaches. Take the class! He lets your rewrite papers until you get an A and is reasonably open-minded with what you can write about. Overall, he's genius.",

            "Professor Anderson is brilliant but makes the class really difficult. Everyone I know in the class got B's on their essays. I only attended lecture a few times but I definitely found I understood the material more by attending. Only take this class if it is a part of your major/requirement.", 
            "This intro to PPE had a huge amount of reading, but she was very clear in lecture. Definitely worth it if you're interested in the material", 
            "Law and Philosophy is a great course! I was extremely intimidated at first, but the class is not THAT bad. Simply do the reading, attend EVERY lecture and pay attention. The class consists of three papers and an essay-based final. Anderson is clear and very, very, very smart.", 
            "224-Global Justice-Is a reasonably easy and definitely interesting class, I recommend it. (also taught by econ prof Thompson)", 
            "Very interesting class. She is very clear in lecture and is willing to help students outside of class. She is very knowledgeable about the subject and obviously loves teaching it. However, this is by no means an easy class. There is a significant amount of reading and it is very hard to get an A. Take it only if you have an interest in the subject.", 
            "Anderson is one of the worst professors I've ever had, possibly one of the worst at U of M.", 
            "She's a decent professor, but the class is graded on a pseudo curve where only 2-3 members of a section get any type of A. Need good writing and analysis skills. You can't BS the essays. Hard final. Good class to take right before law school, but you might want to avoid it fresh/soph. year.", 
            "Dr. Anderson is tough but fair (meaning that she'll always tell you exactly why you didn't get the A). She encourages students to investigate topics of particular interest to the student, and is always availible for office hours.", 
            "Everything an instructor should be. Classes were always stimulating and informative. She is merciful when it comes to sometimes stressful student live. Inspired me to take more classes related to the subject matter.", 
            "The best teacher with corrective lenses since 1950", 
            "Style was interesting, but she sometimes talked in circles.", 
            "If you are an honors student who took Great Books, don't pay attention to the comments regarding the \"massive\" amount of reading - it pales in comparison. Anderson is the best discussion section leader at UofM (after class was over, many were vocal about how sad they were to leave, and one person even took a picture to remember the class).", 
            "Great professor and class. Lots of reading though and depends on which GSI you get. Really hard grading too.", 
            "Terrible class. So boring. Too much reading and way too much studying for the exam. Do not take this class unless you have Jeff Billings as a GSI", 
            "She's a brilliant woman and the class is REALLY interesting. The reading amount is rediculous but you only have to write 3 papers and complete one test...not so bad. You'll be glad you took the class for the insight and knowledge you gain, however the grade may not be as pleasing. I still recommend it. PS: david dick is a phenomenal GSI!",

            "My dislike for this class and for Dr. Bardwell can't be summed up in 350 characters. Although he was intelligent, his arrogance was off-putting, and he was disrespectful. He sent out an email to the students once, berating another professor from UPenn. The coursework was largely irrelevant to protein structures, and pointless in my opinion.", 
            "4 projects + iClicker, no exams. The projects are interesting and help you gain useful skills that are readily applicable in a science/research career. Go to office hours/ask questions early, the projects can be frustrating at first because they are open ended and require use of software most aren't very familiar with. Long projects so start early.", 
            "This was a very different course than I am used to taking because he tests your new knowledge by applying it in projects rather than exams that just your ability to memorize facts. I very much appreciated his intelligence and way of testing ours.", 
            "Dr. Bardwell is hilarious and really enjoys teaching. If you are interested in research then take this class! He lectures about interesting research projects and the technology that we use in the lab today. His projects are tough, but rewarding if you put the time in. I learned how to use awesome software and developed my professionalism skills!", 
            "A really poor class. The lectures are disjointed and poorly taught, and no one pays any attention because it's not very interesting. The groupwork is graded unfairly. The projects are unrealistic: plan to spend entire weeks working on little else but them. I had high expectations coming in but I would not take again.", 
            "This class is not what I expected. I had anticipated a science course about proteins and instead received a lecture-based course of random information & long homework assignments. The lectures consist of non-relevant topics which could potentially be interesting if they were not so long. The homework is hard. Not a bad class, but not my favorite.", 
            "Bardwell is incredible. Four assignments are due throughout the semester that provide you the opportunity to improve your research/presentation skills, prepare and conduct interviews with experts in various fields, and learn to navigate/work with scientific computer software and databases I had previously only read about. Highly recommended course", 
            "Amazing class. Really liked the group projects.", 
            "This is my all time favorite class because (apart from laughing at least once each lecture!) the assignments were the first to awaken me to the social, economic, and technical realities of conducting research. Instead of just teaching me biology (though he did that well), Professor Bardwell helped to mold me into a professional. Take this class!!!", 
            "Applied science class with no exams! Dr. Bardwell is always enthusiastic and you can tell he loves teaching. Assignments can be challenging in that you have to think beyond class material, but definitely fulfilling. When I tried to solve a protein's crystal structure for 1 assignment, I actually started dreaming about amino acids and how they fold", 
            "He has high expectations for his students, and he'll make you want to meet those expectations. His assignments are long, so expect to put in a lot of time and effort. But it's definitely very different from most other Biochemistry classes. He's pretty vague with grading criteria though, so you never know how much effort is enough effort.", 
            "Good professor. Really seems passionate about what he is teaching. Really enjoyed the projects. No exams for this class, just projects and iclicker.", 
            "I took MCDB 411 in Winter 2012 and it was one of my favorite classes at UofM. Dr Bardwell is an amazing professor and truly loves teaching. He made class very interesting and fun every single day. The assignments were a breath of fresh air compared to other science classes. Take this class because of Dr Bardwell, you will absolutely love it.", 
            "Dr Bardwell was one of my favorite professors at UofM. He made every class interesting and fun (his stories are the best). The assignments were a breath of fresh air compared to every other science course I took. Even if you aren't super interested in proteins; take this class because of Dr Bardwell. He's very helpful and a great teacher.", 
            "Very enthusiastic professor, no textbooks, interesting projects. Great lectures & lots of different topics. Lots of software use in computer labs, great opportunity to learn bio-related software tools and other applicable skills. Note that course is NOT an easy A - many get Bs. Prepare for hard work and ask for clarification on assignments.", 
            "Dr. Bardwell has a really interesting and rather different style of teaching. It's not something you would learn in other MCDB classes. A great class if you're interested in exploring about protein structures! We had group projects and assignments that were sometimes challenging but you learned a great deal out of it.", 
            "One of the best classes I have taken at the university. Very application based - important skills for the field and just life in general. I thought the presentations and the practice interviews were great projects and taught me more than any exam could. Dr. Bardwell is very enthusiastic and clearly loves his job. Take this class!", 
            "The class is a great way to get outside of a textbook and try to accomplish real world tasks and develop necessary skills as a researcher. Excellent emphasis on learning to navigate the internet age in terms of databases filled with biology information. Also, you develop teamwork skills and improve your \"business\" savy.", 
            "Great course, great instructor. Lots of interesting side stories to accompany his lectures. Assignments were carefully chosen and taught us skills beyond the class material. Very low pressure classroom since there are no exams and group work is encouraged for projects.", 
            "MCDB411 was one of the highlights of my time at Michigan. Bardwell is enthusiastic and funny, one of the most passionate teachers I have had. I took the class because of my interest in protein structure but got so much more out of it. Beyond protein structure, I learned about careers in science and the professional skills necessary in such fields."

            "Professor Wineman is an excellent choice for ME211. Very clear explanations and gives good guidance on what to study for the exams. He works hard to provide real world examples for the uses of each lecture subject. Downside: His handwriting can be tough to read and the HW load in this class can be high.", 
            "Great teacher, makes lectures interesting. Offers a lot of office hours, very helpful", 
            "Wineman is consistently the best 211 professor. He's very clear about what is on the exams and very clear about what you need to know. His handwriting is atrocious, so you may need the textbook to understand some formulas, but otherwise it's a fantastic class. Some semesters (like mine) had tons of HW. live in the ME help room.", 
            "Very helpful in office hours, lectures were very clear, and tells you what exactly will be on the exam prior to it", 
            "Very enthusiastic and makes funny comments that will keep you engaged. He goes through material really quickly and has terrible handwriting, which also shows up on a lot of the web notes or exam solutions but it's possible to read. I would highly recommend him though, he tells you exactly what will be on exams and they seem to be easier than others", 
            "Wineman explains concepts well and is adorable and entertaining. You definitely don't want to miss lecture - he teaches in depth so you don't have to read the book. Just make sure to take notes as he talks - sometimes his handwriting is hard to read. You'll want to work on homework in the ME help room.", 
            "Wineman is the best 211 teacher. Homeworks are challenging, and office hours aren't very good because alot people come and it can be difficult to get help. However, if you do the homework, the exams are generally straightforward. Uses funny examples and very straighforward explanations. Would take him again.",

            "Offers good explanations and examples and keeps the class engaged. Sometimes he works through things pretty quickly and if you miss it, you're out of luck because his handwriting is near illegible (can't believe no one has mentioned this). Very helpful in office hours. Homeworks are terrible but if you can get through the homework, tests are easy.", 
            "His ME 311 is really easy. It is not just because the 311 itself is not hard, but his explanation s are really clear. He very funny and smart. Review sections are really helpful. Nice teacher with patience explain everything clearly. Really recommend to take his class.", 
            "Amazing. Seriously, take anything he teaches. My only problem with him was I laughed too hard at his jokes and felt awkward. Knows a ton, obviously loves teaching and is super helpful.",

            "Great prof, definitely the best for ME211. Has the easiest exams of all of the 211-profs bc he tests on the basic material and doesn't try to trick. Very laid-back, approachable, knowledgeable, and funny.",

You have to go to lecture b/c he explains everything there and does a lot of examples from the book. Most examples are very similar to exam problems, which are also the easiest of all 211 sections.

I took this class as a senior and its been my favorite at UM. Lopez is an absolute legend, you must take a class with him.", 
            "Professor Lopez is fantastic as all the other reviews have said. He really is a sweet, charming professor who is enthusiastic about what he does and wants his students to succeed. An important note is that the class should not be underestimated as a easy A/slack off class. You need to read the book and study what he tells you (on a study guide).",

            "The rest of the reviews say it all. Very cool guy, funny, interesting topic and a great lecturer. Would recommend. Will say however, your GSI can affect how your grade turns out because they are the ones grading quizzes, exams and the paper. But, super great elective choice!",

The topic was interesting enough that I didn't have any problems going to the lectures and the way he talks about it, you can tell he's very passionate and knowledgeable. At the end of the last lecture, everyone clapped for a minute straight.",

For a 200 level class, he gives a lot of information accompanied with easy grading. For his higher level students, he does have higher expectations, but they're very reasonable expectations to meet.",

Professor Lopez is one of the biggest OG's at the University of Michigan, will casually drop the fact that he is friends with the Dalai Lama and is obviously super passionate about the material. Class is super easy if you attend lecture.",

He is very grounded and down to Earth despite his vast accomplishments in his field, something that seems to be rare with professors of his stature. Very warm individual, want to give him a big hug",

Be sure to meet with your GSI and have them read over your final essay (10 pages).",

He creates a nice atmosphere between the GSIs, him, and the students. Definitely do the readings, don't ever skip class (u wont want to), study tests with the study guide and you are sure to get an A.",

The class isn't a blow off, but the work is worth it, because Lopez makes it so interesting.

No tech in class, so you have to listen and take notes (but you'll want to). But I do have to say: this is not an easy A. Lots of reading and quotes on exam that are kind of hard. Overall I'm so sad this class is ending on Tuesday :(",

Regardless of which course, make sure that you attend lecture. She makes everything crystal clear and straightforward. Students who don't do well likely skip lecture.", 
            "Professor makes the class difficult to succeed in if you don't follow everything she says to the letter. Her lectures are all verbal about the long readings. With nothing to follow the lectures with whether it's powerpoint or writing on a chalkboard, it is difficult to follow everything she says. Her class doesn't foster a successful environment.", 
            "Professor Saxonhouse is finest professors that I've had the privilege of learning under. If you're interested in political theory and you attend the University of Michigan, you would be doing yourself a disservice not to take her class. She's erudite and witty; she also puts together a diverse reading list for the course. Attend class and read!", 
            "Ignore the bad ratings about her. She is a great professor, and if you are interested in Ancient Political Thought, I'd highly recommend her class. She provides a good survey of classical political thought and does a good job at relaying thematic development through the semester.", 
            "Saxonhouse is a kind and knowledgeable professor, very helpful during office hours. If you are interested in ancient thought, this is a great class for you. Exams are long and related to readings. Readings are heavy. You have to take good notes during class. Would recommend taking a class with her", 
            "Though the readings are long, she goes into them in great detail. As long as you take good notes and make sure to reassert the points she has made in class you will get a good grade. Participation is encouraged, but not mandatory. Came into the class with little knowledge of ancient theory, would only suggest interested in ancient thought though.", 
            "Unclear and frustrating. Sit in the front row and listen closely. A tough class because lectures are bad.", 
            "A horrible time for all involved as groans and long faces were common. Oscillates between dull and cringe-inducing.", 
            "Reading is crucial. Specific references to the text will improve your exam scores. Take this course only if you are interested in the history of political thought and are willing to do a large amount of reading.", 
            "This class was a delight. The material is incredibly interesting on its own but professor Saxonhouse successfully transcended the readings by linking them all together in a way that made perfect sense. Her lectures were as helpful as it can get. If you show up regularly and do the readings to a certain extent then this class is an easy A.", 
            "Only take this class if you're 100% interested in the topic. Be prepared to take vigorous notes on everything she says. She doesn't accept outside opinions because she's convinced everything she says is the only answer. The tests are graded partially by her but also by a GSI who has told me that even she gets confused by what Arlene says in lec.",

            "Grades unfairly and does not even grade her own tests. This is done by assistants who aren't familiar with the material by their own admission.", 
            "This class is for grownups. No give aways, it pushes you to learn. 4 hours reading a week and can't miss class. Do yourself a favor- sit in the front, she speaks softly. That said, it was the most rewarding class I've ever taken. Material is brilliant, lectures were full of thoughtful analysis. Included some time for class discussion, questions.", 
            "Arlene is a tough professor. She is strict in her interpretation of the readings and fairly arrogant. On the last day of class, she refused to talk about the reading. She also post minimal resources online and talks like a mouse while telling us to speak up. This is a very difficult course and do not recommend taking it with her.", 
            "The class involves a lot of reading and 3 essays, but that was it. Attendance is mandatory, and you must participate and pay attention constantly in class. Arlene really knows the subject well; however, at times she can be a little picky. This was a class where I worked hard (but not too hard), enjoyed it, and learned a lot, definitely recommend.", 
            "The whole class was, understandably, based off reading the Federalist Papers, but we also read it in class together, which cut into time for discussing and analyzing the text. It also prevented us from being able to go over everything we read. Essay grading is a bit subjective, but she's willing to help if you go to office hours", 
            "Easily the worst class I've ever taken and the teaching style is the reason why. You can feel the arrogance.", 
            "Bad lectures and readings don't prepare one for the tests and isn't helpful in office hours.", 
            "Go to lecture. Keep good, DETAILED notes. If you miss a class, get good notes from a friend. Read. Ask a lot of questions, and visit her in office hours (ask the right questions and she'll basically tell you what she's going to stress for the exams). Like others said, it's not a blow-off class, but almost a guaranteed A if you do the work."

            "The lectures are INCREDIBLY boring and not necessary to get a good grade in the class. DO NOT miss class. Attendance is 25% of the grade. The weekly online quizzes are absolutely non-sensical. They are incredibly specific, and are not significant questions. Tests are HARD. The part 1 of tests are very difficult. (Text identification)", 
            "while there were those who did not attend or pay attention to her lectures, I certainly felt that her enthusiasm for the material and entertaining demeanor made them worthwhile. The class is really straightforward--if you go to class, pay attention/participate you should get an A, however this term there were so many As the curve was downgraded :/", 
            "I honestly think a lot of students are too harsh on Professor Cornish. Her lectures have always been really interesting for me, and it's pretty evident that she puts in a lot of work into them. She also likes to crack a lot of jokes, which really helps me digest some of the more dryer material. You should definitely be ready to read a lot though.", 
            "Worst professor Ive ever had at NYU. Its her first year teaching here and is very clearly shows. She is a very dull lecturer, its hard to stay awake. Takes attendance every class with quizzes on every reading. She really treats you like youre in high school. She doesnt like when people use the bathroom during her lecture...", 
            "Do NOT take Texts & Ideas: Sex & The City with her. Just moved from Michigan to NYU & is aware of how boring she is. Has a major chip on her shoulder. Mandatory attendance is one thing, but today she decided to ban us from going to the bathroom during class. Lots of reading, vaguely worded & difficult pre-class quizzes & the class lacks direction.", 
            "I loved this class! Cornish is such a great lecturer, I love her voice and you can tell she's really passionate about Dante. Read and participate and you'll do fine. I have a newfound respect for Dante after this class. I will forever love the Divine Comedy. Definitely recommend over Great Books winter semester if you are in Honors.", 
            "I went into this class completely against opera, really just taking it wit a friend. But I left with a real appreciation for opera, and I actually like the music now too. Cornish is very passionate about opera as well, which makes learning about them more interesting. The work load isn't tough, but there is A LOT of it. Be prepared before class!", 
            "Prof. Cornish is truly an inspiration for those who love Italian. Listen to the music and study the libretto BEFORE the duedate. Gained an appreciation of opera. Some of the opera terms are hard. If you don't understand, just ask. She loves questions and will clarify, but only if you ask her. Otherwise, she expects you to know EVERYTHING!!!", 
            "Professor Cornish is humorous and approachable so long as students are prepared and participating. She attempts to create a natural flow of conversation rather than simply asking questions and receiving answers. If you haven't read you probably shouldn't bother coming to class. Online quizes were sometimes annoying, but forced you to read.", 
            "There are many comments saying that Prof. Cornish is unfriendly and unapproachable. This is not true. Her class was definitely difficult, but she had truly expert knowledge about the subject and her dark sense of humor through the whole thing was awesome. Italian 333 is one of the best classes I have had to take.", 
            "She is a tough grader on the first exam for everyone. The key to doing well honestly is to #1 read before the night before, its fine if you finish 2 days before but don't be reading the night before. #2 Do the terms! #3 Study with other people! She doesn't like suck ups but still be interested in her class and the material. Dante is really great!", 
            "Prof. Cornish likes to talk quietly, won't use microphone. I think you get extra credit if you have perfect attendance...not sure. Is a little weird, but is genuinely interested in the topic, seems knowledgeable. Exams are pretty fair. Will like you if you show interest in Italy/Italian and if you participate in class. Buy the \"optional\" text!", 
            "Professor Cornish, was a wonderful teacher. Lectures were fun and educational. During office hours she was extremely helpful. She took my interest in Italian and turned it into a passion.", 
            "I didn't believe all the comments here until I had her. Very unapproachable and unfriendly in class and office hours. I dreaded going to class everyday. I'm not a sensitive person, but she made me cry twice before I dropped the class. Definitely would not recommend her to anyone!", 
            "Very interesting class. As long as you take decent notes (no notes available online), this class should be no problem. Cornish was great at dissecting the text and drawing interesting conclusions.", 
            "Painstakingly boring lectures. Prof not approachable at all. Sped through lecture slides and refused to post them on CTools. Seemed to grade subjectively. Mandatory attendance should have been a warning sign...any professor that can actually lead a stimulating course doesn't have to worry about students showing up. Definitely NOT recommended.", 
            "I am talking about Dante's class: terrible class, terrible teacher. Choose another course, if you like Italian Literature!", 
            "If you are an Italian major- take this class instead of Ital 333. It's a MUCH closer reading of Dante's Divine Comedy and it was the best class I have ever taken. I was afraid at first too, don't worry. Warning - she doesn't like students who don't come prepared for class.. but she is the most knowledgeable & interesting professor I've ever had.", 
            "Before taking this class I checked this site to see how it would be. Going in, I was absolutely terrified. There is hardly anything good on here about Prof. Cornish. I created an account just to say that all of those comments are wrong. Her class was very enjoyable and she's pretty funny sometimes! I would take another Italian course with her.", 
            "Will NEVER take another class with her! Very rude, not helpful in office hours at all. Doesn't post lecture slides and doesn't give enough time to copy the slides/what she says. went to her office hours and got was 10 missed points because she was 'half asleep' while grading but no help on what to improve on for next exam."

His lectures are extremely boring, the lack of content on his lecture slides make studying from them impossible. He has no sense of humor and he is not very friendly in office hours. I could go on and on.", 
            "This class has a lot of potential to be interesting, but Professor Sedo makes it more difficult than it needs to be. Lectures are dry and confusing. Very unclear grading criteria for exams. I have blatantly answered exam questions correctly, but they are still marked wrong. Take another 300 level class.",

Unless you have the patience to suffer through excruciating lectures that fail to follow a coherent sequence, you will have to teach yourself the material. Good thing it's not that hard.

The notes he provides on the board are all scribbles, practice exams have more errors, mistakes, and typos than you can possibly imagine. Take his class and it's a guarantee that you'll regret it. I'm surprised that he hasn't been fired from the university.",

Prof. Sedo is completely unorganized and gives little to no exam preparation. (don't be fooled by his practice exams \"with answers\" because the answers are incomplete and useless)",

Whenever I'd ask a question, she'd assume I'm asking something completely different, and throw out an answer before I could finish my sentence. Not the best, but not the worst. But I would recommend another teacher if you aren't good at spanish. You'll do a lot of work in this class.",

I did well in 101, but so did everybody in 280, so 280 is much harder. Many CS wannabes give up after 280.",

The exams are extremely hard and you cannot count on your projects to save your grade. Don't expect any sympathy if you try to submit your project to the autograder even one second late though.", 
            "For EECS 280 Ringenberg contributes to how tough the exams can be. This class IS meant to weed out CS majors, despite the instructors denying it. Many people think after ENGR 101 that they wanna do CS and then say \"never mind\" after EECS 280. He can be funny at times, but somehow I always got bored and couldn't pay attention in his lectures.", 
            "Professor Ringenberg is a very helpful teacher, and he is very enthusiastic about what he does. He understands that even as engineers, not everyone is REALLY going to need extensive code, and focuses a lot of his energy on the logic and mentality behind coding, to get students thinking like engineers.", 
            "In ENGR 101 all lectures from all sections are posted online. Many students not even in Ringenberg's section would still watch his lectures because he is so clear. I didn't attend class past the first week, and just watched online. Projects can be very challenging, do not wait to start them. Exams are open book and open note. Book is optional."

Attendance was mandatory due to stressful in class exercises every class, but she makes lectures fun with her sense of humor. Her tests and hws are incredibly difficult and long, but she's super helpful at OH and really tries to help you achieve. Excellent teacher overall.", 
            "Professor Bertacco is a wonderful teacher. She's engaging, enthusiastic, and a great person to talk to. She cares deeply about actually teaching students and will try her best to accommodate for everyone. She's also very funny and charismatic and a great person to get along with", 
            "Her lectures were great; everything was clearly explained and in-class exercises, while tiresome, definitely reinforced our learning. Beware of the amount of homework in this class though. Especially during the last few weeks of class, there's enough work to drive even the smartest students insane.", 
            "If you get a chance to take a class with her, DO IT. Not only does she really know the material, but she makes sure people understands it. She really cares about her students (she got to know most of us by name) and wants us to like the material. One of the best professors I have ever had at U of M", 
            "I took EECS 370 with Professor Bertacco, she is honestly the best. She really cares for her students. She showed this by learning my name. She is always there for her students, even outside of class. I'll be looking out for other classes that she teaches, because I would love to have her as a prof again.", 
            "Flamboyant lecturing style keeps me wanting to attend lecture. VB is a: Bringer of delicious donuts, Brilliant explainer of tough concepts, Expert in the course material, Funny, inspirational human being.", 
            "Prof. Bertacco is the best! She cares for the students in the class and their understanding, particularly of difficult topics. I really appreciated that she would give us a break and make us stretch and tell us some funny story when she noticed that we were zoning out.", 
            "Professor Bertacco is great at explaining some of the complex aspects of 370. While the lectures can be boring at times, you need to pay attention because she will call on people to answer questions. She seems to really care about her students and would reward those who went to the 9am section with donuts from time to time", 
            "Prof Bertacco is the best prof I have a had at Michigan, she's totally dedicated to the class and a great teacher. I met with her 6 times outside of class, and she was always willing to help me with anything (mostly project stuff). She's definitely not an easy prof, but you'll learn a lot in her class, and you'll learn how to do research too.", 
            "Best prof. I had so far in my MS program. She helps every student with the projects and listens to feedback.", 
            "Best professor I had at Michigan", 
            "awesome prof. Meets with you as much as you need to get your project working.",

            "In this class, neither the professor nor the GSI will teach you anything, and they all just expect you to read papers and build something that's really good and novel. They have high expectation and high standard. Only phD students will like this class I guess.",

            "Beware, old reviews are irrelevant as the course structure/assignments have changed (I learned the hard way). Class was very disorganized, the syllabus is a poor description of what you'll actually learn in the class. GSI's and professors are on different pages, making grading vey confusing. Least helpful group of faculty I've encountered at UM.", 
            "Professor Kivelson was a superb professor in her Medieval Russian history class. You have to stay on your toes with the readings and participation, but she really made the material come to life. She was understanding as well when I needed extensions. Makes you work for your grade, but I found her class to be a rewarding experience.", 
            "Professor Kivelson is clearly very passionate about witchcraft, but her lectures are often scattered and boring, resulted in spotty attendance. The class is not tough, but at some points can be excessively feminist. The first half of the class focuses on European witchcraft and the second on the more interesting Salem witch trials. Easy humanity.", 
            "Kivelson is a nice lady, but a terrible professor. Her slides are so disorganized they are hard to follow. The prompts for writing assignments are vague and even the GSI's can't explain what they are asking for. Grading is harsh. At no point in the semester did we talk about Harry Potter or other movies like the course description said we would.", 
            "She is an incredibly nice woman, and is obviously interested in her topic. She is also very opinionated without trying to force her opinions on other people, which is a nice skill. The class itself is a bit boring at times, but then again, the lecture was at a terrible time in the day.", 
            "I took History 375/Women Studies 375 and it was amazing! It's the History of Witchcraft and is largely focused upon gender issues, which is where the women studies crossover comes into play. Kivelson has amazing lectures, includes a powerpoint filled with pictures and film clips. No finals!! A take home essay at the end and some pop quizzes.", 
            "Kivelson is really great, and I'm not sure why her rating here is fairly low. She takes the time to get to know students and is very friendly and warm. She also integrates pop culture, art, and theater into her lectures, which makes the material more interesting and approachable. She gave a number of opportunities for extra credit.", 
            "Kivelson's class relies heavily on class participation but she doesn't shoot you down completely if your answer isn't completely right. Also I'm pretty sure she knows the name of everyone in lecture, so she puts in the effort. She is more than willing to answer questions and is super approachable (coming from a student afraid of office hours)", 
            "This was a great class and I do not understand all of the bad reviews. Why do people even come to this college if they expect to do absolutely nothing and get an A? Prof Kivelson let you know what you needed to know for exams and I found the material very interesting. What you need to know is very clear and emphasized. Make sure to do the readings.", 
            "Kivelson is fun and tries her best to make lectures fun. They are sometimes all over the place but I recommend this class to anyone who is a history major or a non-history major. She has good content and is willing to help any student who wants assistance. Show interest, and guarantee the GSI or she will be willing to grade you easier.", 
            "Please, for your own sake, do not take a class with Valerie Kivelson. Her lectures drone on FOREVER, and still yet leave you wondering what the hell the class was about. Blue Book exams are TERRIBLE and nobody should be subjected to her course.", 
            "Don't bother going to lecture after midterm. Relies way too much on student participation even in a huge lecture. Some weeks devoted to things hardly related to witchcraft - fairy tales and mccarthyism. Should be a 3 credit 10 week class or something. Everyone just dialed it in the last few weeks. Grading is ridiculous for such simple content.", 
            "Professor Kivelson has a very narrow mindset. She does not allow for any individual thought, rather she is interested on if you can spit back the information that she gave you. Lots of boring readings and many papers in which the feedback is awful. Would not recommend taking this class, for you will not do well.", 
            "Val is very interested in the material that she teaches. Her interest radiates through her while she lectures. Although class can get a little dry on occasion, it's worth taking it to get the A. The GSI you get may effect your grade. If Scott De Orio is an option, choose him. He is a wonderful GSI.", 
            "I took this class my freshman year and it very relatively easy to get an A. Going to class is recommended, and I actually found the lecture material interesting, as well as Kivelson's way of presenting it. Although. She does like a lot of student participation during her lectures, which can get annoying.", 
            "Fine class. BUT val does not know how to give an organized, clear lecture. A lot of times you feel like she is BSing and her powerpoints look like they were made by a 5 yr. old (crazy colors, no organization, lists often start at #2 and you are like \"what?\"). Plus, she makes up words to sound smart (ex. climactical change instead of climate change)", 
            "She is a great professor. If you go to office hours to discuss writing assignments, she is very helpful in improving your understanding. Professor Kivelson is extremely nice as well. I was unable to go home for Thanksgiving, and she actually invited me over to eat dinner with her family and relatives, which was fun!", 
            "I thought this would be an interesting class, but its really just awful. Half the lecture is spent listening to student's reactions to readings/pictures, and the other half is a really sweet professor talking about a whole bunch of bull.", 
            "Not a good class! I thought this class sounded like an interesting humanities course, but I was mistaken. Unless you are history major and like dull class I do not recommend taking this class!",

The GSI's are also very tough graders on the exams. Their expectations are closer to if you were a primatologist than a student. The essay and short writing assignments are graded reasonably.", 
            "I quite literally attended two classes welcome week and never went back. Mitani is great and you can tell he loves the subject, but posts the lectures online and gives study guides that are reflective of the exams. BUT beware... get ready to write fast because they're half short answer and you only get an hour. GSI's aren't pushovers with papers.", 
            "Professor Mitani is super fun to listen to, but if you're not at all interested in the material then don't bother- there are probably easier NS classes. You do have to memorize features of skulls/ be able to recognize pictures but if you study a normal amount then you should do fine. Never opened the book- all the material is in the lecture slides.", 
            "If you don't know, Dr. Mitani is one of the most respected primatologists/biological anthropologists in the field. For you, this means not only do you get a great quality education, but also the academic freedom that comes with tenure. He is openly critical of the university, of the state of politics, and of his GSIs, all with a lighthearted energy", 
            "This class was recommended to me by friends who took it with another prof. This professor gives too much power to the GSIs for grading. My GSI is having us do a huge final project for his part of our grade while a friend's just gives weekly quizzes. The exams are hard because classes aren't well-organized and we watch movies during lecture often.", 
            "This class is not well organized and not well taught. The slides give you virtually no information, so you can't prepare for tests using them, and the professor constantly goes on tangents without connecting his points well to the broader themes or the point. Despite this, the exams are highly detailed and full of arbitrary memorization.", 
            "Amazing amazing professor, but the GSIs will make you regret the course. Put in A level work and receive Bs and Cs.", 
            "Funny professor. Definitely isn't afraid to speak his mind and the class is straight forward. Overall, he's an inspiring professor.", 
            "Prof. Mitani is an awesome lecturer, he plays music before class, talks to students, you can tell he's completely genuine and really wants you to learn. I've gone to office hours and he sat there and talked to me and a few others for almost an hour answering questions and asking us about ourselves. He really wants to get to know you- fantastic prof", 
            "This class is easy but Mitani is terrible. His lectures are erratic and his attitude is inappropriate. He started his lecture with a video making fun of a presidential candidate which resulted in 10 students walking out pissed. Constantly gets off track to make fun of students, other professors, and public figures. Thinks his sh*t doesn't stink.", 
            "This class is straight forward and he is a good lecturer. You have to go to class or else he will notice. My only complaint is that as a professor at a public school, he forgets to be tolerant and accepting of viewpoints other than his own. At least 1-2+ times a lecture, he will throw out a derogatory comment about right-wing politics and women.", 
            "I took this class for Natural Science and Upper Level Writing credit. John Mitani is a great professor and the class is really easy! Tests are very straight forward and the paper was annoying but easy to write! Mitani really makes an effort to get to know his students.", 
            "John Mitani is very passionate about what he teaches and it shows in lectures. Lectures are not mandatory to go to, but I always liked going. He'll post his slides but there's no blue review or notes if you don't go. His personal anecdotes of working with primates were fun. Tests are very straight forward (multiple choice & short answer).", 
            "If you're at all interesting in primates, take this class. He thoroughly covers all aspects of the lives of primates, including a lot of info from his own studies on chimpanzees. He really does make an effort to learn familiar faces. Good conversations are to be had if you go to his office hours. Paper is kinda tough but that's expected (ULWR)", 
            "Mitani is basically famous in primatology and is a very undergraduate-friendly professor. He wants people to be interested in primates, and I've come to love them through this class. He really tries to get to know his students. Enjoyable lectures. Short answer part of exams are tricky, but if you get a good GSI to prepare you they're fine.", 
            "His lectures are pretty good. But fair warning, his tests are extremely annoying. He gives you a midterm that would be hard to finish in an hour and a half and expects you to finish it in fifty minutes. There is a multiple choice portion that isn't to bad but the writing portion will absolutely destroy you. There are about 15 short essay questions.", 
            "Tests are odd, easy multiple choice coupled with incredibly subjective and non-specific short answer questions that are graded very tough. The material is interesting and Dr. Mitani definitely knows his stuff.", 
            "John's really cool. He plays music at the beginning of class and walks around learning people's names. His lecture style is a little unorthodox, and once he learns your name he'll notice if you don't show up to class, so fair warning. All lectures are posted on blue review. Cracks the occasional corny, though enjoyable, joke.", 
            "Lectures were on blue review, but if you do go he makes an effort to get to know the students by name in a large lecture. Lectures are clear cut, and exam questions are based on slides. If you have had bio before this class is a breeze, if not you will need to study. Exams are fair and there is no cumulative final.", 
            "Lectures could get a little monotone, but he is a great prof who really knows his stuff. He explains everything really clearly in lecture and tells some enjoyably corny jokes. I would definitely take a class with him again!"

            "Simply the best professor I've had to date. EECS 482 is a very difficult, very high workload class, and Prof. Chen does not make it easier. But his teaching and dedication is phenomenal, and you will leave this class feeling like you've grown as a programmer.", 
            "Peter Chen is a solid lecturer, but more importantly, he truly cares about his students. He takes time to learn their names and personally help them out on Piazza. He doesn't go easy on them, but their success in his class is very important to him. I also had him for ENGR100 and my experience therein is the reason I chose to take 482 with him.", 
            "Most dedicated professor ever met, remember every student's name, and he sometimes answer questions on piazza after midnight", 
            "This course has definitely been one of the most learning-intensive courses I've ever taken. Be ready to work longer hours than you ever have on projects, and don't rely on OH to save you. Prof. Chen is an entertaining professor that appears to care (and even memorizes your name); but in reality, you're on your own.", 
            "I LOVE PETER CHEN.", 
            "One of the most dedicated professors I've ever seen -- really cares about his students, even gets to know the names/faces of each and every one. That said, the class (Microprocessors and Toys) is very difficult and while lectures are 'not mandatory' the recordings are low quality and there is no textbook, leaving students low on study material.", 
            "The projects for 482 are overwhelmingly time consuming, and it's that easy to lose so many points on the exam. However, EECS482 with Peter Chen is still the best course you absolutely want to take; it partially defines what kind of programmer you'll be.", 
            "Amazing guy. Amazing professor. Amazing advisor. Best professor I have ever had. Definitely take any class with him that you can", 
            "Explains everything very clearly, good notes, tough exams. I felt for some concepts he takes too much time and it becomes boring.", 
            "Best Professor I have ever had! Extremely helpful and inspirational.", 
            "Amazing class, loads of work. Do not take this class with a heavy workload.", 
            "Professor Chen teaches a very difficult course, but he teaches it very well.", 
            "Soooooo much work. You better have a good group, otherwise it's going to suck. Pchen is awesome at lecturing and i was tricked into thinking I knew the stuff cause he was so good. But according to the projects, I did not know the stuff. I'm pretty sure I failed, but now I know about multi-threading and file systems which is good to know. Good luck.", 
            "Chen is the bomb, take a class from him if you have any chance to. 482 is a lot of work and he makes you think, but Chen is the best professor to teach it.", 
            "Honestly you won't find a STEM professor as caring as Peter Chen. His class was very difficult but professor Chen will not give up on a student who does not stop from seeking help.", 
            "What an amazing professor. Best I have had at U of M. Memorized everyone's name (the class had 100+ people in it). At office hours he was extremely helpful. This class was really really hard, and the projects were insane. But I learned a ton, and Chen (& the GSIs) were always there to help. Also had students over for Christmas dinner, fun!", 
            "Professor Chen has an incredibly organized lecture style and presents material very clearly. He makes what can be difficult concepts easier to understand. His autograder is merciless and projects take a while and are conceptually challenging, but there are plenty of office hours, especially around the due dates.", 
            "Best professor I've had in EECS. Very strong lecturer on very interesting material. Projects are quite difficult, but doable if you start early. Be sure to go in with people you know, having a good group is imperative. Material is also extremely relevant in industry!", 
            "Prof Chen was the best prof I've had at this university by far. Yes, his exams are a bit hard, but they shouldn't be a problem if you are legitimately interested in EECS. Lectures are great: everything is clearly explained. Microprocessors & Toys is a \"must take\" if you are considering EE/CE. Expect a lot of work 2nd half of the semester, though.", 
            "He is a great professor. Exams were very difficult and projects took forever, but I got a lot out of the class."

            "Prof Chin is a good professor, and this is an interesting class, but some things to look out for - don't expect to do well if you don't do the (large amount of) reading, participation is key, and she didn't post a single grade on canvas, so your final grade is based off of things you don't even know the grades of. Overall a decent class, just tough", 
            "This class (Muslims in Contemporary Europe) was much more history-based than I anticipated, but still interesting. But make sure you like reading. Like, up to several hundred pages of reading per week, every week. And don't expect to get an A if you don't do them. P. Chin is intelligent & available, not terribly boring and clear expectations.", 
            "Prof Chin is really an amazing, intelligent professor. She offers an unbiased perspective on a really polarizing, complex topic (Muslims in Europe). This class isn't an easy A but it's really interesting and you'll do well if you pay attention in class and do the homework. I definitely recommend it to anyone, even if you're not a history major!", 
            "One pop quiz. Readings are given once weekly and reviewed in class. However, you don't really need to read (they're long!) just skim. However, the readings she selects are very good and educational. I especially recommend reading Murder in Amsterdam. The File is good too. Talks a little slow/just repeats what's on the slides. However, good content", 
            "Prof. Chin was great and was extremely knowledgable about a difficult topic (Islam in Contemporary Europe). I enjoyed her lectures, the books she selected for the class to read, and our discussions. She doesn't try to steer the class in a particular direction and this made discussions interesting and full of differing views. Take this class!", 
            "Rita is an amazing teacher. Very approachable and willing to help! Engaged the class and lead us to some really great conversation. As a freshman she was invested in our success in her class and school in general", 
            "Lots of reading, but I learned a ton. She's really approachable and understanding\u2014a life saver seeing as attendance was mandatory but I occasionally slept though my alarm....", 
            "In a small, intimate class, Prof. Chin was fantastic. Knew the material, but most importantly she let her class discuss. When she interjected,it was merely for guidance, but the real substance was provided by students. Do the reading and engage in the class and you'll be fine. See her in office hours for papers and she's very helpful.", 
            "Amazing class! I absolutely loved lectures with Prof Chin. She was extremely clear and detailed in her lectures and I gained a really solid foundation in post-1945 European History through this course. I also loved how the course examines current issues in Europe today. Highly recommended class for anyone interested in contemporary history.", 
            "Rita Chin is a great professor. If you pay attention in her lectures then the material is really easy to follow and she is willing to answer any questions you may have. Depending on the GSI, this class is easy to do well in.", 
            "Nice down to earth woman that's always ready to help. Her lectures can't be anymore clear than they already are and she does a wonderful job laying things out for you from A to B. I'm most likely going to take my colloquium with her in the fall", 
            "Prof. Chin is excellent! Teaching style is discussion based lectures. Class formate: short weekly reading summaries, mid-term, final paper. She's thorough and would highly recommend.", 
            "Professor Chin is one of the best professors I have had! Every lecture is well thought out and organized. She also does a great job adding material in order to supplement her lectures (movies and songs, for ex). The exams and paper are also very reasonable. Overall, one of the best classes I've taken! You'll definitely learn TON!", 
            "She is a good teacher. Her lectures aren't terribly exciting, but I learned a good deal from the class. She is very willing to help her students.", 
            "Professor Chin was an excellent teacher in every way. She was knowledgeable, engaging, and understanding. I enjoyed her course on the European Left very much due to the exciting discussions we had about fundamental issues like capitalism, socialism, human nature, and how they related to our readings and today. Definitely take a class with her!", 
            "Dr. Chin was very knowledgeable about such a relatively new academic topic. Therefore, while I think this was a great class, I can only imagine it getting better in the future. Professor Chin's lectures are very clear and she stresses the points she wants you to know. Lots of reading, but the reading material is interesting and even fun to read.", 
            "Professor Chin's course on the European Left was a truly transformative experience, and easily one of the most interesting and thought provoking courses I've taken at Michigan. We engaged difficult theory in an intimate class setting, and still had a lot of fun in the process. Highly recommend this class and Professor Chin.", 
            "This professor seriously did not prepare for her lectures. She expected us to read about 200 pages a class and instead of drawing from the readings she lectured from separate notes, and routinely paused for a minute to collect her thoughts/find a point she had written in her notes. This had the potential to be a great class, but I dreaded it.", 
            "Not helpful, nice, interesting, or approachable.", 
            "she was a really good professor. really valued input from GSIs and students, and seemed to alter curriculum after feedback from previous semesters. definitely interesting material covered. Don't need to read the textbook ever, just the articles on ctools. keep track of IDs throughout the semester to make your life a lot easier"

You are sitting in class going over texts, but it all seems like it is research for the professor's next book. If you have a question, she may mumble some vague answer but do not expect instruction.",

She pushed every student in the class to do their best but it ended up being incredibly rewarding. She is definitely tough but she is willing to put in the work with you to make sure you grow from the experience of taking her class.",

She would start to make a point and then switch her train of thought completely way too often (every other sentence).

She teaches history in a kind of \"storybook\" format, with little care for solid factual events. Personal bias is evident. Powerpoints consist entirely of pictures, which makes studying a bear. If you can find another prof, do it.",

            "I initially took this class because I wanted an easy course - I didn't think I would love it this much! Prof. Porter made what would seem to be a rather well known time period be seen from a compeletly different light! His lectures are clear and his iClicker quizzes are fair. Reading is a must, and you get about 100 pages per week, so beware.", 
            "This was the second class I have taken with Brian, and it was amazing. He always kept me interested in the material, and blew my mind at least once a week. The blogs can be annoying, but you get used to writing them after the second week. Easily one of the best professors I've had.", 
            "Easily one of the best classes I've ever taken. His lectures are amazing--at least once per class Professor Porter blew my mind. If I could take this class again, I would. It's that good. He finds ways to keep your attention for the long lectures, not wanting them to stop. Daily quizzes necessitate readings, but they are entertaining anyways.", 
            "Prof. Porter did a very good job of teaching this course. Instead of just talking about events and dates, he really made the class more about overarching themes that made you really think about the period. I learned many things thanks to Porter and I think he's an excellent professor. Would recommend.", 
            "Prof. Porter has been one of my favorite professors at the University. He is enjoyable to listen to and a great resource outside the classroom. Get him talking about polish history and you might become his new best friend. He is a fair grader, but do the work. He really looks for effort and original thought.", 
            "Very interesting lecturer, all of the grade is based on in-class quizzes and weekly blog posts, can be a little tough to get an A but impossible to fail. Porter-Szuc is of the rare breed of professor who seems interested in teaching his course rather than torturing his students. Highly recommended.", 
            "Hands down one of the most passionate and helpful professors at this University. Lectures are delivered like a sermon, which makes class interesting. Prof. Porter goes out of his way to help students. Class is easy in the sense that there are no exams, but you must keep on top of the reading, as 75% of your grade is based off that.", 
            "BEST PROFESSOR I'VE EVER HAD. His lectures are awesome and he is so smart. The class is kind of hard, but it's not unreasonable. Attendance is very important because he has quizzes every day, but there are no exams or papers (just weekly blog posts). He rocks, I'd highly recommend this class. I learned a lot and enjoyed it."

Most students I've spoken to agree and are clearly uncomfortable when she is around. She seems to have a poor understanding of how to properly interact with students and is very harsh about the course rules.", 
            "Rachel Barnard is the queen of condescension. She manages to find ways to embarrass even the GSIs in lab in front of their students. She has no respect for the GSIs or students and treats most people like they are 5 years old. She has almost no control over your grade in CHEM 125, so don't worry too much if you get stuck with her, but try to avoid.", 
            "Extremely rude and condescending to both the GSIs and the students in labs. Coursework is excessive for a 2 credit class and expectations are not very clear. Would not recommend taking this class with her if you do not have to.", 
            "Absurd amount of work for a two credit class. Extremely unclear expectations. Rude to GSIs and students.", 
            "She is the sweetest thing. No exams, only lab reports. I think 50% of your grade is lab performance. There were also two quizzes and one pre-lab. You have to stay the full 3h in the lab which is a pain but they will give you something to do if you finish. My GSI was David and he was fine.", 
            "Told no homework outside of class. Definitely need to read and reread lab procedures before performing lab", 
            "Rachel was not a very clear lecturer with lots of mistakes. GenChem itself is really stupid though. You learn all of this stuff in lecture that if you've ever had a chem class before you know (which makes it really boring) and then the tests are pretty difficult and nothing like the material learned in lecture. Also, unnecessarily hard iclickers.", 
            "She was not helpful at all. I found most of her lectures to be a waste of time, but still mandatory to attend due to iClicker questions. Her iClicker questions were sometimes confusing and about material that you didn't even read. She also didn't answer some questions asked. I would not recommend taking this course with her at all.", 
            "Barnard really tried her best in teaching this class. Although this is true, GenChem was terribly boring to me still as someone who just took it as an engineering pre-requisite never to be used again. She made the iClickers unnecessarily hard and seemed to get pleasure out of when a lot of the class got it wrong. GenChem is boring and difficult.", 
            "Rachel could be confusing at times, but she did give an effort in trying to make the material seem less dry and actually interesting to her students. Gen Chem itself is a tough class, so I wouldn't necessarily attribute the difficulty of the class to Rachel, rather the course material. I did find her iClickers unnecessarily difficult however.", 
            "It's true that Chem 130 is a hard class and there's no getting around that; however, despite this I feel that Rachel could've made the class a little easier. The iClicker questions were hard and most of the time trick questions, and Rachel wouldst answer question on them. Overall, not easy but not hard enough to take another prof.",

            "The other reviews about Rachel are unjustified. Chem 130 is a tough course no matter who you take it with. Reading before lecture is necessary and her lectures really help establish concepts. I thoroughly enjoyed her as a lecturer and she is so sweet too. She is really good at answering any questions you have. iClicker questions can be tricky.", 
            "She's absolutely horrible. She is the least helpful/insightful person I have ever had the disluck of meeting. She often treats her student with a huge lack of respect and only talks to one student in our whole lecture(S/O Paul). Try to avoid her, but if not, then may the odds be ever in your favor. But, because she's awful, they won't be. So sorry", 
            "iClicker questions are unnecessarily difficult, they don't accurately reflect the complexity or difficulty of even some of the harder test questions. She is not clear with her work, she cannot spell, goes too fast, offers little help when asked, and is a little too condescending for her level of experience (lack of). Steer clear of this professor.", 
            "She's an ok teacher. Just make sure that you don't just copy the notes without listening because she has a tendency to write wrong information on the slides by accident.", 
            "Dr. Barnard is a very bad lecturer and teacher. Not only is she unclear in the way she teaches, but when you ask her a question she either gives you a vague answer or tells you to consult with a classmate about your question. I couldn't wait until my last lecture with her. She also gives tricky iClicker questions before even explaining any material", 
            "Absolutely horrible professor. You might as well skip lectures since the iClicker questions are all trick questions and she is absolutely useless at lecturing anyway. She regularly makes mistakes teaching basic material in lecture, and is horrible at answering questions. The tests are absolutely horrible as well (girl left the 2nd midterm crying).", 
            "Rachel Barnard's lectures are very tough. In addition to barely skimming over the actual content of the class, the students must complete 7 or 8 clicker questions that sometimes are trick questions or don't make sense at all. If you ask Ms. Barnard a question, she will either give a convoluted answer that makes no sense or give some bs answer."

Also the exam was pretty hard.",

The data project was also fairly easy and the content was very interesting! Definitely recommend taking his class!", 
            "Kollman's lectures were interesting and he was engaging. posts all of his lectures online and most of the exam questions come right from the lectures and he always emphasizes what will be on the exam. he does use the class roster to cold call on people during class, and takes note if you aren't there but show up and you're good.", 
            "He's a fine lecturer, although honestly he can be very boring. Also makes you buy the textbooks that he wrote...",

He's great but his grader this past semester was pretty tough on essay portion of the exams. The multiple choice section was literally taken directly from the quizzes.", 
            "This class is great! You have to go to class because there are daily quizzes, but it is beneficial because he literally uses these quizzes as his midterm and final. He breaks the class into groups and goes over readings (This is the whole class, very little lecture). The class is pretty laid back. Overall he is a great professor.",

            "Kollman is a very concise and articulate professor. His book is very clear and digestible. Section is really annoying and often feels unnecessary. Exams are pretty easy if you study well but make sure to focus on The Reader notes, theres a disproportionately large number of questions taken from it.",

There's a lot of reading but I was very interested in the material so it wasn't a big deal to me. 3 exams, 1 paper, and a daily reading quiz in section but overall not an obscene amount of work. Recommend to anyone with an interest in poli sci", 
            "Professor Kollman is the man. I wasn't sure about majoring in PolSci when I enrolled but I definitely am going to now. The class is somewhat reading heavy, but I thought a lot of the reading was really interesting. Kollman is an engaging lecturer and passionate about the subject. Really great intro to Polsci.",

I took the class in an election year, so he repeatedly brought in current political situations in discussing political systems. I found that his lectures are very well done and the quizzes are easy.",

The GSI's while helpful for preparing for exams are incredibly hard graders on the one paper you receive in the class. And will not accept anything but a straightforward uninteresting paper that regurgitates the theories",

The class itself is mostly pretty easy, with four 10 question MC quizzes and two 50 MC exams for the mid term and final, but the essay (25% of grade) is GSI determined, and some of them grade fiercely.", 
            "Pretty tough for a 100-level course. You need to read the textbook and the assigned articles pretty closely to do well on the exams. He's a good lecturer, and a really helpful/nice guy during office hours. Very interesting course, I considered majoring in Polsci after this.

He's passionate and knowledgeable about the material, but I think immunology in particular is a very complicated subject which can be challenging to teach regardless of proficiency level. I had difficulty learning in this class initially, but many other students did not, so you may have a better experience with Dr. B.", 
            "Thought he was a great biochem professor. Super clear about what you need to know, and it's obvious he's been doing this a long time. If you put in the work, it's most definitely possible to do well on his exams. Wish he was the only one that taught this class!", 
            "Dr. B is fantastic. He is very tough but clear on what he expects from his students. He actually makes biochemistry entertaining and tolerable. Extremely helpful if you take advantage of office hours and is always willing to help.", 
            "Dr. B is an exceptional biochem professor. He gets the point across, and explains the material extremely well. I would recommend re-watching all of the lectures because he talks very very fast sometimes. He can be pretty sassy, but it's honestly pretty funny. He's also super approachable in office hours.", 
            "He is a very engaging lecturer, and does a good job of presenting a large volume of material. However, he can also be a bit sassy in person, so I'd recommend approaching your GSI for one on one clarification. The exams are entirely based on lectures, so definitely re watch them before each midterm and rewrite your notes.", 
            "Dr. B is a wonderful professor who teaches biochemistry well and wants to ensure that all his students fully understand it and succeed. Is it a tough class? Absolutely, but only because of the volume of the material. Dr. B is really kind & approachable. He will point out when you are wrong, but does so very respectfully. Study hard & ask questions!", 
            "Dr. B is a great professor who teaches well and is always open to questions. It's clear that he truly wants the best for his students. That being said, the class itself is difficult, and there is a lot of material to memorize. However, the exams are all very fair and Dr. B is always accessible through piazza, email, or office hours.", 
            "Go to office hours, join a study group, and attend discussion and you'll be fine. I personally loved this class and learned a lot from it. Dr. B is very approachable in person and genuinely wants his students to succeed. Memorize the slides word for word and don't bother reading the book if you're looking for an A.", 
            "In all honesty, Dr. B was the worst professor I've taken at the University. His general attitude makes students afraid to ask questions in lecture or attend office hours. The grading criteria was very unclear and the exams were near-impossible. He's incredibly smart and knowledgeable about biochemistry but honestly it's not worth your GPA.", 
            "really hard and nit picky have fun! he has Attitude (capital A)!! he's very engaging and throws in some empathy towards his students haha he's very intimidating to ask questions to but he will do so if you do have any :) good luck!", 
            "Dr. B was a fine lecturer who clearly cares a lot about the material. The lectures themselves are intrinsically too dense to absorb in one sitting, so I can't really blame him for the nature of studying biochem. He could be kinda harsh - would say \"meaning no disrespect\" right before disrespecting you. His energy is great though!", 
            "Dr. B may seem tough during lecture, but he is very helpful if you go to office hours. He really does care about students doing well and will help you with any questions you have on the lectures and on the cell map. Reading is completely not necessary so don't rent the book. His lectures provide everything you need to know for exams. Study weekly!", 
            "Kenneth was a poor instructor. Although biochem is known for being a difficult class he just made it more difficult than it had to be. Was very rude to students at lecture and office hours. Would not recommend taking biochem with him unless it is a MUST", 
            "Condescending. Makes students feel horrible for asking questions. Made me hate going to class. Would not recommend", 
            "Extremely condescending. Makes learning very difficult. Save your frustration and avoid his class if possible.", 
            "Dr. B is amazing in terms of teaching and explaining material; however, he does expect a lot from his students to the point where it can be a bit overwhelming. He can be a bit sassy, but it's really not as bad as a lot of people say. Biochem is definitely a very challenging course, but the curve is generous enough where an A or B is well in reach.", 
            "Dr. B is awesome!! This class was tough with a TON of material, but he presents it very clearly and in the best way possible. He is very ready to help anyone who needs it. Yes, he can be condescending at times, but it is SO worth it to take the class with him anyways. He made this class one of my favorite science classes at Michigan!", 
            "Dr. B is very knowledgable about biochem. He is a good lecturer but sometimes goes too quickly/packs his slides with information, making them difficult to follow. He will help if you ask for it, seems like he wants students to do well. Exams are decent and mostly memorization but the 4th is basically cumulative and definitely the hardest.", 
            "Sure while he's reasonably clear, he isn't welcoming at all. Patronizes students for asking questions over material he glossed over in lecture & basically insulted 1 student's intelligence. I finished the class with an A+, but I can't it was for mastering the material-exams are challenging by virtue of being nitpicky and verymemorization-dependent."

Spanish is not an easy topic, but Kristina is a wonderfully kind person who works to make the process fun and interesting. She is talented, devoted and a lot of fun. Take the class.",

Really engages students with the material, and she is incredibly passionate about teaching and her students. Relates the material to her students' lives and the world in general, which is great. Highly recommend.",

            "Funny and a really good teacher. Spanish 103 is a really simple class regardless of who you take it will. Compared to other Spanish teachers, she's not too intense with participation but if you're planning on taking a higher level Spanish class practice participating here. It will affect your grade, participation matters.",

            "Kristina is probably one of the best profs for spanish at UM. She was the course director this year for 103 and even put the textbook together. She really knows what she is talking about, and is easy to understand. She is also very funny and entertaining and made a subject that I hate somewhat enjoyable. I highly recommend taking her class!",

Assigned over 3,000 pages of reading throughout the semester and didn't reference a single reading. DO NOT take his class, biggest mistake you can make.", 
            "Lots of long, boring readings, 150+ pages a week. I enjoy American history, but found this class to be a lot of primary source reading of obscure events that didnt connect back to lecture. Professor Hancock is very thorough but dry. I had a very good GSI who was a lot more lively and helped me make sense of the material for exams.", 
            "This isn't a brush off class but I learned a lot. Just graded on Midterm, Final, and a 5% map quiz so beware of that. I really enjoyed the class and I came away with a few good books and a lot more knowledge about the American Revolution. No homework that you have to turn in but the readings are necessary to pass the exams.", 
            "He sent me the rudest email I've ever received from anyone. I disagree with his historical philosophies-- he focuses on details rather analysis, which makes lectures, discussions, and readings boring, dry, and useless. Taught an upper level writing requirement and gave no feedback on writing. Don't recommend.", 
            "Great guy overall. Really enjoy his class. Very knowledgeable in the topic and his office hours are like a gift from heaven. If you want a challenging class with a very generous grading system, take him.", 
            "I took history 265 this past semester and it was a breeze. I didn't read one of the long readings assigned to us but showed up to discussion and lecture and payed relatively good attention. You don't have to read anything and if you can write well its not hard to bs your way right through the SA midterm and final", 
            "Awesome professor. Very nice, with a great sense of humor. His lectures can be filled with a lot of information sometimes, but that's about it. Midterms are medium difficulty. That being said, he's pretty much always in his office or willing to answer any questions you have. He's very enthusiastic about U.S. history. Would take again!", 
            "Very wordy guy; get past that and you're golden.", 
            "This was one of the hardest classes I have taken at Michigan but also one of the most rewarding. Professor Hancock immerses you in the 18th century with a variety of resources. While he doesn't expect you to remember every detail, if you put forth effort you will come away with a greater understanding of the time period.", 
            "It is astounding how somebody could take the most interesting period in US History and make it SO unbelievably boring. He drones on about the attitudes of British Dukes and his time living in English palaces. Readings are not connected to lecture, and its hard connect the dots. Seems like a tenured prof who doesn't care anymore. AVOID", 
            "Easily the most boring course I have ever taken. His lectures are long and tedious. After a few lectures I felt more like a court stenographer than a student, producing over five pages of notes in an hour and a half class period with regularity. Readings generally exceed 200 pages per week.", 
            "Class is hard, attend and do most of the (lots) of reading to do well. Prof Hancock is helpful if you go to office hours (GO if you have questions) but is a little intimidating and can be arrogant. His lectures can be monotous sometimes but they're very informative.", 
            "Rather old school, somewhat arrogant, somewhat indimidating. He is a nice guy though. Class is designed to make you learn, and you will if you do all the reading (which is a lot). Exams are reasonable, broad questions, not nitpicky garbage.", 
            "Arrogant and boring. He will drone on and on, no matter how few people pay attention.", 
            "I'm a history major and he is quite simply the worst I've had at U of M. Useless readings that don't relate to anything, focuses on obscure events and ignores everything else. Reading assignments for an easy week were around 250 pages. Avoid at all costs.", 
            "His class, though an intro class, had very little intro. Little to no coverage of major historical events, instead focus was on smaller, less interesting aspects of early American life.Boring as hell, lectures were useless, i went to less than half. GSIs were no help- dense, boring, long readings. 150+ pgs a week. Not recommended. Avoid if you can.", 
            "Not impressed by the way Hancock taught this class: based it solely on primary documents, which meant that you basically had to teach yourself historical facts and background online. Strange mix of miniscule details and broad themes, delivered rather arrogantly- your basic intro history class, in other words", 
            "Made the Revolution come alive. Good balance of military, political, and social developments. Use of slide images is great and helpful.", 
            "One of the best available. Always in his office ready to answer questions. His lectures are clear and concise, with lots of visual imagery. Not hip, but informative.", 
            "Prof. Hancock is an exceptional professor. His lectures are interesting and comprehensive. Hist 461 made me more interested in the history of the American Revolution. Prof. Hancock does a great job because he is sensitive to the needs of individual students."

Only good if you're looking for a P/F class that doesn't require any effort at ALL.",

He is very tough on grading as well, which can be frustrating when youve only known the material for a week. Also, I am not unconvinced he is actually a baboon.", 
            "Roger is a great professor. Other reviews claiming that his class is difficult are slightly dramatic. If you show up and participate at least twice per class, you'll be fine. The tests are not too hard, and his grading is fair.", 
            "I loved this Professor, but he had a very specific teaching style. I can say that I learned more in one semester with him than I did in four years of high school French. Would recommend.", 
            "Roger is honestly a decent guy; he is engaging when he talks to you but definitely expects a lot of participation. He is a tough grader, which can sometimes be frustrating because he is not always clear about expectations. You have to learn nearly completely from the book and it can be hard to get clear answers from him.",

He is a tough grader and expects a lot, which can sometimes be frustrating because he is not always clear about expectations. You have to learn almost entirely from the book and it can be difficult to get clear answers from him.", 
            "Contrary to many of the reviewers, I don't think Roger is a terrible person. That being said, his class definitely requires hard work if you want to do well, and that will be hard work on your own time; his shortcoming as a professor is his lack of explanations.", 
            "Roger is not a bad professor and these other reviews are highly exaggerated. Come to class, participate, speak French, do your homework, and study and you will do fine. Learning a language is difficult and isn't a walk in the park. Roger makes you work for you grade but you definitely see improvement at the end of the semester if you've tried.", 
            "Worst teacher I've had at Michigan. If you aren't fluent in French he will go out of his way to humiliate you and make you feel stupid. Avoid at all costs",

            "Roger's the man. I went into the course terrified by the reviews I'd read on here, but was very pleasantly surprised. He was always very helpful and engaging, and was fun to joke around with. He looks like he would be really intimidating but he's very understanding and accommodating. Don't be scared if you get him; he made me enjoy French again.",

That being said, he does a decent job of teaching and explaining, but material is taught quickly and it can feel overwhelming. Overall not a bad professor, but it definitely wasn't the best class I've had.",

It is important to be alert in class and participate consistently. If you do this you will likely enjoy your time with Roger and learn a lot about the French language.",

If you don't really care about french then you should be fine but he honestly ruined the language for me and I used to love it. What a shame", 
            "I loved the French language until taking this class. Roger makes it unenjoyable and overly difficult; he is also very liberal which is reflected in his grading of writing assignments. A nice guy but not a good prof.", 
            "If you appear to be interested and volunteer he's much more patient and helpful. Explanation of grammar is vague. If you write your essays with any view but liberal, expect lower grades; which is beyond frustrating. Though the material was interesting and tests were fair, I can't say I'd sign up for another of his classes.", 
            "DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. He is a rude, egotistical a**hole who picks favorites at the beginning of the semester and hates on everyone else. He treats students differently both in and outside of class. It's unnecessary. He even grades differently depending on the student.", 
            "I am shocked to come here and see these positive ratings! I pray that no one has seen these and unknowingly subjected themselves to the misery that is any course taught by Roger. His liberal bias is unmatched and he literally does not tolerate dissent of opinion. He is rude when people make mistakes. He seems nice at first, DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS", 
            "Roger is really helpful outside of class- he helped us create an additional French section at the 270 level when many students found all classes closed. Overall, his class is interesting- though you don't do enough grammar to really improve that field. You will start writing argumentative essays- make sure you're ready!"

Homeworks are very easy but do not resemble exams since everything is done in MATLAB. Exams do not test your understanding accurately since they are multiple choice and some questions can be very tricky.", 
            "I'm not sure if it's the newness of EECS 351 or not, but the way the material was taught was not very clear for the majority of the semester. Lectures are mostly crowded power point slides of theory with little to no hard examples. Tests are difficult because homework is in Matlab and that is not used on the exams.", 
            "His exams are multiple choice and some free response. Little mistakes can ruin your grade. He is very helpful in office hours but sometimes can leave people a little confused. He explains the material well and you don't need to go to discussion if you are at lecture. Either you understand the material or you do not.", 
            "Yagle is hilarious and being in lecture is enjoyable. However, exams will get harder if averages are too high. As long as you're un undergrad, EE grad schools require the professors for undergrad EE courses to separate the good students from the not so good students, even at the 400 level. This is one of the courses that is pseudo required for EEs.", 
            "Yagle is very hilarious and I often enjoyed listening to his jokes in class. The course notes are great and you therefore don't need to buy any books. Homework isn't very time taking. Exams aren't terrible, but multiple choice is annoying when you get it down to two choices and pick the wrong one. If you're unprepared the exams can really get you.", 
            "Class is harder than anticipated. Yagle is a good lecturer and I enjoyed going to class, but multiple choice exams just aren't right for this course. I always got it down to two choices and picked the wrong one. In lecture you will often hear him say \"don't expect a lot of sympathy if you get this wrong on an exam\". Course notes are very useful.", 
            "Yagle is hilarious and I liked going to lectures. Exam 1 was easy, but don't let that fool you. Exam 2 was hard and exam 3 was harder. I felt prepared after doing the practice exams and the actual exam was another story. The averages were still high because of the international students who had already learned this stuff back at home.",

He switches between expecting everyone to be crazy smart and know everything and expecting us to know nothing and calling us nerds. Easy exams, projects are a little harder especially his grading. Dress pants w white tennis shoes erryday.",

The exams are multiple choice and tend to be easy enough that getting one question wrong makes your class rank plummet. Very hard to get an A in this class, but an A- is very doable.",

            "Yagle is a great teacher. You can tell that he is there because he wants to be there. Homework isn't long but requires thinking. The course notes and his lecture slides are pretty helpful (don't need the book). Exams are either really easy or really hard and are multiple choice, which kind of sucks. He tells funny jokes to make lecture interesting.", 
            "Yagle is an awesome professor who shows that he is interested in teaching. He explains things well and the workload for the class is not bad at all. Exams are easy, but anything less than 100% means your rank in the class plummets. He tells funny jokes in class and gives us a short break in between. Provides great notes, so no need to buy the book.", 
            "He is a superb lecturer. His lecture slides might be stuck in the past, but all the content is there. Good sense of humor, and he is willing to go to any end to make sure you learn the material. The exams weren't easy, but he basically tells you everything that will be on them. Discussions are not worth it if you attend lecture.", 
            "Yagle is a really smart guy, he just struggles to transfer that information in a intuitive way. On the up side, his class was really easy and pretty interesting. Both the final and midterm have three questions, with given formulas.",

He's a very harsh grader- he told me I wrote like a middle schooler, but it didn't keep me from loving every one of his classes!",

I write for TV now; both his entertaining insights into directors Welles and Kubrick and his honest assessment of good and bad in my sophomoric work of the time help me earn a living. (And no, I'm not the sophomoric writer in a certain story, one I'm sure he still tells.)",

It's a course on illicit drugs so I think it's necessary that the course is hard to weed out those who just want to take the class to see what illicit drugs are the safest to take(of which none of them are). Don't let that be why you take this course because it is a popular GPA killer.",

He CANNOT take criticism and he is strict in his policy. I went to lecture everyday but don't bother. Just watch the lectures from home instead.",

Then I come to this class and get a D. Does this say something about me or this course? Hmm... Content is easy, but the exams are so wordy and twisted.", 
            "Denver isn't the friendliest professor, but he knows his stuff and teaches it well. The material isn't difficult, it's just very time consuming. That said, it's far from impossible to do well- just show up to class/pay close attention to the podcasts. Lecture isn't mandatory, but the iClicker questions are bonus points.", 
            "Professor Denver is honestly a great professor. I started off a little shaky in the beginning because my first exam grade wasn't the best. The key to doing well in his class is if you attend lecture and literally write down EVERYTHING he says and then study and memorize it all. I also went to his office hours and he was more than helpful.", 
            "AWFUL COURSE. DO NOT TAKE THIS. The professor is a complete ass. Never answers questions straightforwardly, always refers you to the syllabus. Test questions are about the most irrelevant details. He tests you to see how well you read his notes as opposed to the material. Worst class I have ever taken, and I took MCDB 427 so thats saying something.", 
            "In a class that is 80% seniors, where we're definitely trying NOT to blemish our transcripts with a C or affect our med/grad school acceptance, it is unheard of to expect this much out of students for a 5 credit course, much less a 3 credit one. The average was a C+ and it was graded on a straight scale. 3 exams. GL getting an A - 94% on each one",

The grade for this class is based solely on exams, and he didn't curve the class even though the average was definitely a C+ overall. His exams don't encompass endocrinology.", 
            "Terribly impossible class. I studied the most for this particular final out of all the exams I have taken at U of M(including chem 351, orgo I and orgo II exams) and still received a B-. All questions regarding grading are rudely directed to the syllabus. Exam questions are worded confusingly and test you on the most minute details.", 
            "He refuses email communication and suggests you read the syllabus or go to office hours. Scored above average on the first exam (80-75), highest in class on the second exam (98-78), and did well on the final (90-80). Studied 40-60 hours each exam and STILL didn't 4.0. This class has a straight scale and as the exam grades suggest, GL getting an A!", 
            "This class is probably the most frustrating classes I've taken at this university. The exams are directly from the slide; however, the exam questions ask about the most minute details on those slides. Unless you have a photographic memory, avoid this class at all costs.", 
            "How many amino acids is this? why is this named this, who discovred this? 418 proves there is no question irrelevant enough to be left off the exam. instructor does not seem to realize what introductory level means. Every detail he assigns or glosses over in class is excruciatingly tested. Class is not so bad if you have a PhD in endocrinology.", 
            "Grading is based on 3 exams worth 300 points. Professor's exams include material or animations not covered inuring class. Wrong class even for top students!", 
            "I sit in this class angry because i know that the tests, which are 100% of the grade, will glance over important things that should actually matter and aska bout minute details that we will all forget hours after the test like how many amino acids are in inulin. I was excited for this class but lost interest very quickly.", 
            "Denver is a really boring lecturer, but the easiness of his exams totally makes up for it. You can sleep through class and still get an A. I had this class split half-Pavgi and half-Denver, and the difficulty did not change, even though Denver presented the harder material. Exams are a breeze.", 
            "GREAT professor! I had him for two classes, MCDB 418 and Bio 225. Exams are 100% fair, and you can do well if you attend class, take good notes, and study hard. He is also very intelligent and knows a ton about both subjects. He is definitely one of the best professors at the University of Michigan.", 
            "He's ok. I dislike that I wasn't able to get the professor I actually signed up for because she had a family emergency. While I have many complaints about his teaching style, the biggest is his voice. It's much too soft, and makes lecture hard to focus. Also, he's not very good at time management, he spend far too long on the outline slides!", 
            "Professor Denver took over for the professor who was previously supposed to teach this class. First off, he is a very kind person. Secondly, he is extremely passionate about what he is teaching. He wants his students to succeed and he answers our questions happily. He also offers a lot of resources to his students. He made me like Animal Physiology"

            "Great class, however you really have to put attention in class because his exams are not only about the slides but some of the things he says. In other mini courses you just have to memorize the slides, if you do this in this class you ll get max a B in the class, keep that in mind.",

The book he wrote had at least one mistake on every page, his slides had mistakes, and in-class examples had mistakes. I never saw anyone get a satisfactory answer to their question, and many responses were along the lines of \"can't you see? it's obvious!\"", 
            "Really really bad, tons of mistakes on slides as well as the textbook, cost me a lot of time looking at those materials full of mistakes. Horrible lecturer...", 
            "Lectures are very hard to follow but since it's a tough class, it is hard to self-study. Exams aren't too complex but requires a solid understanding of the material.", 
            "Pinaki is a nice person, but he's not a good professor.", 
            "This was the worst professor of my college career. He teaches 270 like a joke, honestly would have been more prepared not coming to lecture. It's sad when he forced me to lecture by calling me out in class, and the class gave me an applause because I did better than him. I shouldn't be able to do that.", 
            "Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", 
            "Just in case anyone was wondering, no, Pinaki is not any better at 427 than 270. Between Mudge and Mazumder, I think Pinaki narrowly wins the worst EECS professor award. Mazumder is the only prof I've seen who has actually ridiculed and embarrassed students during lecture (Oh, you don't know how to do this? Go to the whiteboard and show us anyways)", 
            "Mazumder was a horrible professor. The only reason I managed to pass the class is office hours. At least twice a week. The class in general was HORRIBLY managed, like they didn't care at all. Don't take unless you have to.", 
            "Would not take any other class with him, ever. I took this class because a friend (who took it with another prof) told me it was very straightforward. Not if you take it with Mazumder. Lectures weren't helpful. I still didn't do well despite actually going. You are better off avoiding this class with him, even if it means waiting another semester", 
            "You can tell that Mazumder has good intentions, but this class was just not a good experience. When you have trouble understanding something, he calls you out in class. Homework was impossible to complete without getting help from the GSI's office hours. Exams were not fair. Should have listened when told to avoid this class.", 
            "Not the best professor for an introductory level EECS class. During lectures, he would talk about interesting but completely irrelevant material that was far too difficult and outside the scope of EECS 270. The exams were not too hard for me because I carefully read the book, but the lectures were completely useless. There's not too much homework.", 
            "Does not teach material efficiently. The course pack is hard to follow and barely has space to take notes. He is intimidating and very rude sometimes in office hours. Homework can not be done without getting help for most of the homework. Exams are extremely long which makes the student feel like he has not learned enough", 
            "I could definitely tell that he cared about us learning the material, he just was pretty bad at teaching it. His slides and lectures were all over the place, so unless the concept was easy, it was hard to follow. Near the end of the semester a lot of people stopped going to class. If you're on the fence about taking his class, I would hold off", 
            "Mazumder has good intentions, but has a hard time dumbing down the material for people seeing this stuff for the first time. Not the most clear lectures, so you may have to research the material yourself when doing homework. Most people stop going to class. Exams (especially midterm 1) aren't the most fair. Labs are enjoyable though.",

            "Not very helpful during office hours, and gives hard homework problems. However, he does prepare for each lecture and makes good jokes (and makes fun of the textbook). Comparing to other 270 instructors who I happen to know, he is above average. But i you just want to pass it without getting a solid foundation and deep understanding, avoid him.",

Assigns hw that he hasn't even taught how to do, so you basically have to go to office hours or teach yourself how to do it. A lot of times, the GSI's he's chosen don't even know how to teach how to dohw",

I can deal with sub-par teaching, but this guy's ineptitude is too much to take.", 
            "Whatever you do DO NOT TAKE ECON 102 with Miles. He is the worst teacher you will ever get. He should transfer to teaching marketing as all he ever does in lecture is promote HIS OWN WORK. He teacher 400 level work in a 102 class and expects everyone to get it right. The only learning happens during discussions where Miles is not to be seen.", 
            "There is no structure in this class. His blogposts are too hard to follow, and he posts blogs one day before an exam, expecting us to know them by the next day. His lectures are never on par with the readings assigned for that week.", 
            "The exams are based on his blogs. Class is extremely unorganized and we receive about ten emails a day, all with essay-long information about what new blog post we should be reading. There is stuff we need to study for in two different blogs, a twitter, and who knows what else. Going to discussion for this class is crucial- that's where you learn.", 
            "Easily the worst teacher I've had at Michigan. Started off the semester saying \"don't expect the same level of organize as your 101 teachers, they are a lot better than me\". Lecture is completely pointless, besides clicking in, but is used for him to promote his blog, twitter, and tumblr.", 
            "During lectures he rambles for literally the entire class about his blog. Class is a joke as he only uses it to promote his blog. He is very disconnected from his class on the whole. His lectures do not correlate with the assigned readings. When it comes to exam time, your best bet is to study the textbook and any online handouts. Good luck.", 
            "Not a fan of powerpoints, not a fan of going over the book. His packets are hard to follow...but if you read the book and attempt the prac exams and listen to your GSI in discussion the class won't be terrible. Also even though the material in lecture may never find its way to the exam, he kept my interest for the most part.", 
            "Very smart guy, but he has trouble articulating himself. His tests are based on the textbook and class handouts, but you really need to master the concepts to do well on tests. Professor Kimball does care about teaching though, go into office hours if things don't make sense and he'll make an effort to help, although this may involve extra reading.", 
            "His handouts are very hard to understand. He does a bad job of explaining them too. Lectures are very inefficient, he rambles a little. He doesn't do a good job of preparing you for exams at all. Textbook reading was pointless, doesn't help you for the exam at all. His exams are tough, and a lot of the material isn't in the book."

            "The worst lecturer I had at U of M (of 160+ credits). Grading is subjective and not transparent. When it's not, a TA said several assignments were graded on \"text density.\" You get feedback on 50% of grades; 25-30% total are not returned. You only learn from your own from the project. He reads verbatim off slides. Difficult to meet with. Arrogant.", 
            "Good professor for engr 100 gaming for the greater good. The class sucked overall with techcom and little things ruining my grade (especially considering i knew exactly what was going on always) It's a required course though so you'll have to chose a section and if you do, i would chose this one", 
            "Arrogant, thinks he's so smart when in reality asked him several questions that he could not answer.", 
            "Dr. Chesney cares for his students. If you reach out to him, he will most definitely reach back. With his class, you will get out what you put in. His lectures are full of great stories and the work is actually meaningful. Dr. Chesney cares a lot about teaching you not just the material, but also how to be a good CS engineer in general.", 
            "Dr. Chesney is a really cool guy, especially if you're interested in Computer Science. His lectures are always very interesting and you will not go through a class without having laughed at least once. Top-notch guy.", 
            "Probably the biggest flaw with ENGR 100-650 is that we, the students, had pretty much no clue what was going on. We would sort of listen to the lectures, and not apply them AT ALL until the Midterm. I don't think many people knew what was going on in that class. Although to be fair, Dr. Chesney's stories are great and the project was great fun.", 
            "He is rude and inconsiderate. He also seems to have little respect for student privacy.", 
            "Told interesting stories but was full of himself. The class in entirely dependent on the groups that you are assigned to and if your group is not favorable, then Chesney is not very understanding.", 
            "He is the best. He always has great stories for class. If you are interested in CS take gaming for the greater good!! He runs class in a very laid back way. Lectures were often directly off powerpoint. Exam was more difficult than you might expect but overall a great course and lecturer", 
            "I really liked Chesney. He was passionate about the class and worked with us (the students) to make sure everything went well. The workload of the course was what you made it, since you planned your own project. He could have been more clear about some things.", 
            "Likeable guy. Class not boring. Dr. Chesney is patient and listens to the students. Explains things very clearly and spends extra time on important stuff. He sometimes uses helpful physical demonstrations to illustrate concepts. Projects aren't too bad as long as you allot enough time for them. He's not very forgiving of failure.", 
            "The class is kind of cool, with a solid aim to help kids with ASD. Professor Chesney is able to bring in a lot of external help, from UMHS and from Microsoft, which is eye-opening and mimics the real world environment well. However, his teaching lacks organization. The exam covers too much trivial stuff simply because he talked about them in class.", 
            "Uncaring in 280, harsh in 281, and rather lenient in 481. Consistently clear but sometimes verbatim lecturing (he seems to have read stuff out of the book). Exams can be painful. 281 projects and psets difficult. Almost straightforward in 481, except for pop quizzes. Not good with questions. And never whine in front of him or be late to class", 
            "Asked me to put away my laptop while I was taking notes in lecture (in a computer programming class ??) Also, wastes a lot of time / takes a lot of breaks to let you work out problems you should be doing outside of class anyway. Don't bother going to his lectures unless you really don't understand the lecture slides.. available online..", 
            "I loved his section of the mandatory \"professionalism\" class.", 
            "He's crystal clear in teaching course materials. He keeps the class interesting by telling cs/non-cs related anecdotes and past experiences. Overall he's very likable, and I really don't see where those harsh criticisms come from.", 
            "I am dissapointed in EECS students for these reviews. EECS 281 is a demanding course and David Chesney is getting the bad rep for it. He has no tolerance for students that slip-up on late assignments and try and milk their grade out of pity. He uses great visual examples and explains things clearly. He is open to questions. He is a great teacher", 
            "Prof Chesney doesn't respect his students. He doesn't like giving help or advice either. Outside of lecture, he tries not to be involved with the class - leaving everything up to the TAs. I expect more from a college professor.",

            "Great professor, passionate and lively. Straightforward material presented clearly. No book to buy, everything comes from slides. 4 open book quiz's and a final. Clear expectations, minimal homework and no surprises. No reason not to take this mini-course.", 
            "Jamie was an excellent teacher. Class was easy and very informative. He was specific on what he wanted on each assignment and was clear on what would be covered on each quiz and exam. He is very enthusiastic about his work and the classes he teaches, and when combined, make the classes far more engaging. Take the class.",

            "He is literally my spirit animal. His love for the course speaks volumes as to who he is as a man. I firmly believe that he is the best professor on this campus. We do not deserve him. Yet, we are so blessed to have him. Highly recommend. I have never truly lived until I took this class. Such an enlightening experience!", 
            "Joke of a class. If you go to lecture, pay minimal attention, and study a little for the final, it's an A. Quiz averages in the class was about a 90-95+ every time. He is quite boring during lectures though. As long as you put some effort, it's an easy A.", 
            "I had Jamie as a lecturer for my global change class. Although the class itself wasn't super easy, that was mostly due to the labs (STELLA modeling is not my forte). He is passionate, caring, and by far my favorite lecturer for the class! Would love to be in another one of his classes someday!", 
            "This class is very easy, and the material is interesting. Jamie is really funny, helpful, and clear in his explanations of key concepts. Labs are straight forward, and the GSIs are great. Tons of easy EC on the midterm and final, very clutch. Show up to lecture because he gives you a lot of info that isn't on the slides that is helpful on exams.",

            "Best professor at the university.", 
            "Made geography fun.",

I do not care about the subject of global warming, but Dr. Gleason got me a bit interested in the topic. As long as you pay attention minimally, you should be fine.", 
            "Great class but still not convinced.",

Weekly quizzes that aren't too bad and he seems to want everyone to pass. He also really knows what he's talking about and is super passionate and helpful.", 
            "I took Gleason's 1 Credit astronomy course. It is vey well taught. He is a smart, kind man. I did, however, find the final to be pretty challenging for a 1 credit course. Mind you it is the only graded assignment he provided the whole term. Class average was in the B range. Not a breeze by any means!",

            "Love Adam! His lectures are really clear and the exmas are reasonable, although it may be difficult for those who don't pay attention in class.", 
            "Brilliant and talented lecturer. I would definitely recommend taking his class. The classes is curved so you have to be competitive. Test are average difficulty. However, a lot of though has gone into the lectures and the presentation of the material", 
            "Really loved Adam and the class. Thought that he did a great job of keeping lectures interesting and explaining topics well. Averages on tests are usually sort of low, but definitely not impossible if you study. Also, he has a great world sense and does a good job of adding in current events to make concepts more relatable.", 
            "Class was very difficult for me and the curve is rough. I think Stevenson give great lectures, sometimes goes too fast, but records them to counteract this.", 
            "Stevenson is a Keynesian man. He will crush your conservative beliefs with a Keynesian hammer and turn you into an intelligent, spending person. Also, he will give you plenty of time for iClicker questions, as his countdown to close the questions goes, \"3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0.\" What a man.", 
            "I hadn't taken any high school economics or Econ 101 before this class, but with a little bit of studying and with the really informative lectures, I was able to understand the content really well. Stevenson talks really fast, but he makes a lot of sense. Attendance is mandatory because of iClickers, but I would recommend his class.", 
            "Stevenson cares about the class and is super passionate, but he doesn't seem too adapt at teaching an intro level course. This was super math heavy for an intro econ course and he explains things very quickly. You can tell it makes sense to him, but it won't always be clear to you. The homework is hard and will take some time.", 
            "Very knowledgable, prepared, and clear professor. Lectures are engaging. Iclicker points are annoying but helpful. Tests were harder than expected and practice exams come in handy. Some questions were poorly written. Other than that, great proff.", 
            "Take Cho. Stevenson's course is significantly harder. He talks insanely fast and rambles in his lectures, is barely accessible outside of class, and his exams are very difficult", 
            "Good professor. He is really passionate about Econ and it definitely shows during lectures. Post lectures online but you'll have to go for points. Just rewatch his lectures, do the homework and GSI section problems, go to review sessions, and look over the old exams and you'll do fine on tests. HW is a bit tricky so start on it early.", 
            "Lectures are super fast paced and the class is very math heavy. Definitly need to put in work to do well.", 
            "Stevenson is a tough grader but the class is super interesting and he is extremely passionate about what he teaches. The exams are tough and I'd recommend going to discussion sections because the practice problems help. There are weekly homeworks due and occasionally article responses (3 times for the semester). Tough class but great professor.", 
            "Disliked Professor Stevenson. He is definitely passionate, however he talks incredibly fast and jumps all over the place. As somebody who did very well in macroeconomics, I felt this was an entirely different beast. If taking 102 at Umich, I suggest taking Cho.",

            "Although he is hard and is very math intensive, if you go to class and work through and review hw problems and GSI section questions you will be fine on exams. He is enthusiastic about the material and you can tell he really does care about the topic.", 
            "Talks way too fast in lectures but records. iClicker, but lowest five removed. Unnecessarily hard homework, a friend said office hours were helpful/he always finished his hw in OH. Study a lot for the exams - not cumulative, but tricky wording (MC+short answer). Can buy old textbook edition, textbook only needed for homework (read only 1 chapter)", 
            "He talks fast, but Adam's incredibly passionate about economics and honestly entertaining to listen to. Go to class and discussion. Do the homework every week and do the practice exams. You should get an B+/A- if you just do what's expected.", 
            "Material is very interesting but he covers a lot in each slide during lecture so be sure to go. Also be sure to read the book because my grade on each exam was correlated to how much I read the book. Exams are tough so be sure to put in the time for them.", 
            "Decent at presenting. Attendance is scored by iclicker questions and he gives you five days to skip."

Don't miss the opportunity to have him.",

            "It's not demanding- lectures are not required to go to since they're posted online. No textbook reading is required (wasted money on that..) There are 3 big assignments that are easily done, although quite annoying. I've learned a lot from the class about myself. Some say Katch is arrogant, but he's just old & healthy, let him be.", 
            "SO. MUCH. INFORMATION! Katch seems to be a nice guy but it was just ridiculous. The smallest details were on the exams and the assignments were so tedious and pointless it was unreal. You'd have to REALLY enjoy nutrition to have fun in this class. I quit going to lecture and just used the online slides because the lectures became boring.", 
            "The exams are ridiculous. He says to, \"Not sweat the small stuff.\" But they're on their. A couple of the questions are bogus, because he puts 2 correct answers on their, and pretty much it's a 50-50 shot, even though both answers are correct. I love Nutrition, but this class doesn't reflect nutrition at all, and neither do the exams.", 
            "I don't know how anyone can call this guy rude or arrogant- I think he's hilarious, and this class may be the easiest I've taken in 4 years. There are 3 projects and 2 exams, all simple. You don't need the book, just look through lectures and you'll ace this class. V. Katch rocks, one of my favorites. He's so enthusiastic you can't help but laugh.", 
            "What an awful teacher. He feels very high and mighty about himself, and openly mocks kids in class. His ego gets in the way of teaching a good class. I would hate to take another class with him, unfortunately I'm required to. His lectures were boring, he's very unclear about a lot of information, and the tests do NOT reflect the lectures.",

Makes class fun, not to mention he's funny. We watch a lot of movies, and he lets you out early sometimes. I HIGHLY recommend this class! :]", 
            "Professor is rude, arrogant and condescending. He makes fun of students in class. This speaks volumes of his character. Luckily, you don't need to see his face to do well in class. Take this class if you need an easy A, not if you're looking for a mentor...because frankly, he just doesn't care.", 
            "interesting topic, interesting videos, pompous prof. when giving stats and numbers, he would often have 2 diff sets for 2 diff lectures. homework is tedious and he can be overly critical. I came out of the class w/ a B+ w/o doing the ex cr, so it wasn't terrible, but he definitely made me reconsider transferring into kines bc he supposedly teaches", 
            "Took for 240 and 241. Katch is by far one of the craziest most scattered profs I've ever had, but I really enjoyed the class material. 241 is a lot more straight forward than 240, but much more difficult as far as course work is concerned. Workbooks take hours to finish, but definitely help. 241 assignments take forever, but I'd take him again.", 
            "Easy class, just read a little and do the assignments. The homework is tedious, but there's only three. Lots of extra credit, I didn't do it and still got an A with a bit of studying (it was tedious, like the homework). Class was very boring, some interesting videos that wind up on the exam though. Seemed nice, very funny and knew his stuff.", 
            "He is the WORST professor at the University of Michigan. His lectures make no sense and are full of spelling errors as well as factual errors. His tests do not reflect what he teaches. He tells you not to sweat the small stuff, but that's what appears on the exams. Absolutely terrible class.", 
            "ridiculous class .. boring lectures, assignments EXTREMELY tedious (who honestly records every singly activity of their day for the amount of time to calculate the caloric value -- even peeing), incredibly unclear as to what would be on the tests (first test had 14 chapters on it, the 2nd only had 4) .. overall, pretty much a waste of time",

If you want to know a TON about Japanese Buddhism, take his class!!",

Professor Auerback would be extremely helpful when you are working on your take-home paper. He could provide you with an unimaginable number of sources for your research.",

He's awful at breaking stuff down and assigns WAY too many readings. Not to mention the GSI's are clueless and the exams are blue book. I HATED this class. Take my advice and DONT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",

Reading might be a bit much but come on people it's college... Overall one of my favorite classes at the university. Forget all these other people; take the course!", 
            "Eastern thought is immensely complex. It is far more experiential than technical. Given that, Auerback is a really solid professor. The material is incredibly difficult to teach, but he is really understanding and chill with his students. The GSIs can kind of suck though. They seem to have less of a clue than the students.", 
            "Yes, there is a fair amount of reading. Yes, some of the material is rather dry. But overall, it's a fairly easy class. Just study hard for the exams and there is no reason why you shouldn't do fine.", 
            "If you either value your free time or your GPA, then don't even think about thinking about taking this class. Somewhat interesting material, but the amount of reading assigned is beyond absurd for any level of any class in any field, let alone a 200-level intro class.

She can really relate well to the students. Tests are easy, she's a little dumb when it comes to computers and using the online course tools.", 
            "this class was a pretty easy A. I didn't even realize I was going to get an A because I didn't perform that well on the first two tests. She gives a tonnnn of extra credit if you go to class every day, and the GSI's are very chill (make sure you get pilar!) Mcneal is hilarious and entertaining and that makes up for the class being so early :)", 
            "This class was great. I looked forward to going to lecture each day (even though it was really early). The exams are hard, and the wording is tricky, but she warns you about that ahead of time. Take time to study for the exams and go to all the lectures, and it's really easy to get an A.", 
            "Class is WAY too early but she's a very funny professor and tries to have fun during class. the exams are pretty difficult but graded very fairly and its very possible to do very well. lecture is only an hour and sometimes thats way too short.", 
            "very interesting class", 
            "Teacher is HILARIOUS and approchable. On days when attendence was low she'd give a few points of extra credit to those who were there. Subject matter was interesting, at least to me, and she did a good job explaining things. Class was fairly graded, although quality of discussion relies on GSI.", 
            "i took a soc 101 before this class and it was extremely different. her notes seemed unreal and very difficult to understand. her lectures and definitions were unclear and it's tricky, but overall it wasn't bad. i think soc 101 helped me a lot",

            "She knows nothing of what she is talking about, her exams are VERY unclear, and during exams, she is often correcting her mistakes, leaving students and herself flustered. If you want a teacher who knows what she is talking about, then don't take this class.", 
            "Dr. McNeal is hilarious and she is very politically incorrect, which I like, but her exams are ridiculous. She likes to make them very hard, you have to study hardcore. The class itself was great, and in our last lecture she played a rap song, got up on the table dancing, and made everyone dance or they would lose points. She's nuts, I love her.", 
            "Not a good sociology course, exams are poorly written, not very available, information in lecture is frequently inaccurate."

But he asks you to explain things by yourself on the exam. I heard he started doing this recently and his exams were okay before. Please take other prof if you aim to get A.", 
            "class was insanely difficult with Tilman. He is extremely understanding and a genius (he's the highest paid econ professor at UM). However, he doesn't really understand whats difficult for his undergrad students, so his exams are very difficult to do well on. Do not take unless you have a VERY strong calculus conceptual understanding.", 
            "Probably the professor to have if you are taking 401. Exams are difficult but there are resources like practice problems, lecture notes, and homework will help prepare for them and he is accessible outside of class and on Canvas. Just keep up with the materials and you'll do fine. GSI was bit of a downer though.", 
            "Prof Tilman's circulates lecture notes which help to a great extent in understanding course material. Be sure to constantly keep up with the material - homework, practice problems and past exams are a good way to review course material. Exams are challenging but doable. Lectures aren't dry and he keeps students engaged.", 
            "He's trying a new teaching method starting this semester which is not working. You have little to go by for what's going to be on the exams. I don't think he intentionally tries to make the exams impossible but he doesn't understand what's difficult for people so the exams are end up being extremely hard. Probably shouldn't teach undergrad.", 
            "Class material is very hard and his lectures dont help at all. Just rambles and expects students to understand the material. Ended up just having to learn the material on my own. Exams were very difficult and the class average was below a 50. For the hardest class in the econ major felt like he did little to make it easier.", 
            "Easily the best professor I have taken a class from at Michigan. Crystal-clear in class, and really helpful in office hours. Truly cares about his students. I only got a B-, but it was very well worth it and I would take another class with him any time.", 
            "do not need textbook. All multiple choice questions. But it is the hardest course i have ever taken. Lecture is useless and no extra credit.", 
            "Tough class and not a great lecturer. I learned most of the work on my own and class is curved so my grade had nearly nothing to do with his teaching. Was hard to learn from his lectures and ended up just studying independently to do well in the class. Textbook was completely useless and waste of money", 
            "If you're going to take 401, take it with Tilman! He was fair, and made a bunch of jokes that wouldn't be funny unless they're coming from a Professor. 401 isn't as awful as everyone says as long as you stay on top of it and try. Also, take advantage of pooled office hours if you think you're struggling.", 
            "Realizing how good I had it compared to 402 with Cravino. I thought he was one of the best Econ professors I've had, he explained things concisely and was entertaining in lecture. 401 like most Econ classes is one where you have to work through the problems on your own to understand, but his lectures were useful and discussion was very much so.", 
            "It's a hard class but he is a great lecturer.", 
            "After not passing this course, I have taken it with another professor starting with the letter P, both of these professors are pretty horrible but tilman was absolutely worse. Disregard most of the ratings before the fall semester of 2014 as he changed the entire system to writing only, no multiple choice, all written exams. He was ruthless to me.", 
            "not good", 
            "Tilman was a great professor for Econ 401. It's a tough class and requires a lot of work, but he provides lots of extra resources to make sure you succeed and wants to see all of his students do well. Very helpful in office hours and responds very quickly to forums posts and emails. I would definitely recommend taking 401 with Tilman.", 
            "He is a fantastic professor. He explains material clearly and concisely in a positive manner. He knows what he is teaching really well and is confident with the material. Overall, great experience with a great professor. Plus, he wears purple sweaters!", 
            "One of the worst experiences of my life, my GSI would grade really tough and when I complained to him he went off on me during office hours. He grades really tough, all you need to know before taking this class is partial derivatives, chain rule, product rule, first and second order condition and you should be fine. He FAILED 30 STUDENTS, UNREAL.", 
            "Hard class. He is a good prof. He cares and gives students lots of time. Most people teaching econ aren't really even profs, they are lecturers. All econ majors need this course for the degree - absolutely the best person to take this course with. The lectures can be really funny.", 
            "What an incredible professor! His clear, well thought-out lectures and attentiveness to the students, I was able to grasp a lot of very difficult subjects. Spent extra time on the harder concepts and stressed those concepts until he was sure the students understood. By far the best econ professor I've taken at Michigan.", 
            "You need to go to lecture for this course; the side comments are very funny. He changed the exam style from previous years and got rid of multiple choice tests. Being good at math alone will no longer get you the grades. First Prof I've ever had here in a large course that is really accessible . He seems to really care that we learn."

And he still manages to speak super slow and be completely unprepared for the class almost every day. Probably the worst professor I've had at U-M so far.", 
            "Mudge somehow made me learn in a negative direction.",

            "Really not that bad for this course. He clearly knows his computer architecture stuff and does a reasonable job of explaining it, I think the lower level courses limit him too much in dumbing things down. There are better options to take 470 with, but he's definitely not a must avoid for this course like he seems to be for 270 and 370.", 
            "Took 470 Here to solidify Mudge's position as the worst teacher or professor on this site in umich, it's a quite feat No disrespect, the teaching is just bad, and everyone knows it He didnt even make his own slides for heaven's sake. He doesnt know how to use a ipad pro either", 
            "Mudge was awful. 370 was co-taught by 3 professors and the other two were great, but Mudge was just not. He's apparently really smart but he doesn't seem like it. His slides are full of mistakes and he acts like he's seeing them for the first time. He's constantly going back and correcting things he said which makes it very confusing. Avoid.", 
            "The course is co-teached by three professors. The other two are great but Mudge seems to be a sharp contrast. Lectures are unclear and Mudges sometimes just seems to be unprepared and gives wrong instructions.",

EECS 370 is taught by multiple professors and I recently realized that the class was extremely hard in the beginning because he did the majority of the lecturing. Avoid him at all possible costs.", 
            "I had the \"pleasure\" of having Mudge for EECS270 last semester and for EECS370 this semester. He might be one of my least favorite professors at U of M. The funny thing is I'm pretty sure he invented some of the stuff we're learning in 370 right now yet sometimes it feels like he still has no idea what hes talking about.", 
            "He's on a rotation with 2 other guys who know their stuff, so in comparison his class is a circus. He acts as if he's just seeing the ppt slides for the first time, and will point at diagrams and refer to every thing as \"this\". He'll frequently go back and correct himself on things 5/10 min ago. Doesn't help his slides are riddled w/ errors.", 
            "This guy blows!! he doesnt look over the powerpoints before lecture and is always confused during lecture. They had to restructure the whole 270 and 370 program because he is that bad. The teachers now rotate between classes so you arent stuck with him for the whole semester.",

            "Knowing he's teaching 470 next term lets me shun that course, because taking 470 with him can imply no help from the instructor, struggling with teammates for the major design experience, learning nothing from the lecture, being destroyed by the exams, wasting tuition, regretting, and losing interest in computer architecture.", 
            "Going to his lectures is a waste of time. Not showing up to office hours and coming to lecture unprepared are both very true of him. He taught 270 last semester, is teaching 370 now, and will unfortunately be teaching 470 next semester.",

His lectures are incredibly boring and he literally just reads of the lecture slides which he posts online, so you literally don't need to go to lecture if you read the book/lectures. Quizzes every discussion section but they were super easy, only 6 questions each. The class could've been way more interesting.", 
            "Seems like he's used to teaching higher level classes, but still obviously knowledgeable in the topic. The class was easy if you fill out the study guide, and everything was interesting to learn about. Lectures can sometimes be boring but aren't necessary to attend", 
            "Boring lectures, mandatory discussion attendance and weekly quizzes, need to read the textbook because his lectures don't cover everything on the exam, medium difficulty.", 
            "Smart, nice guy but he talks fast and can be hard to follow. Boring lectures that rely heavily on slides, don't bother with the book. A lot of material covered in a short period. 3 tests determine your entire grade and questions can be unnecessarily convoluted. Do poorly on a test and your grade tanks. This class ruined my 4.0. Avoid if you can.",

My only gripe beyond the boredom is that the weekly quizzes in section can be a pain.", 
            "Very easy course with easy material, but Jim does not teach it well. His lecture slides are not organized and focus on information that is rarely on the test. Pretty boring and dry lectures. Will give exam review sheets and an extra credit option, easy to get an A. Weekly quizzes in discussion. Hope that you have a good gsi, Jim doesnt teach well", 
            "He's not a bad guy, but he is a terrible lecturer. His lectures are very dry. If you're actually interested in the subject material, I would recommend a different professor, but if you're looking for an easy A and credit, he's your best bet.", 
            "He makes this class about the basics more entertaining. I got 100 on the first exam so I stopped reading the book and still got As on the last two exams. Just go to lecture and pay attention and you will be fine. Also, if you took any psychology in high school this class will be incredibly easy. It is mostly just memorization.",

            "Hoeffner is generally understanding as a person and a professor. He responds to emails and cares about his students. However, his lectures are kind of boring unless you really make an effort to listen. The PSYCH111 material is very interesting, especially for psych majors. Go to discussion sections, they have quizzes that really affect your grade.",

If you're taking this for your major Hoeffner is an easy A and really great, but if you're taking it for fun, it's better if you have a different professor.",

He makes study guides, easy exams, and is overall a super nice guy.",

The three tests make up 80% of the grading in the course so if you do poorly on one exam it can tank your grade. Luckily he gives you a comprehensive study guide and practice exam a week before the exam. He can be really funny sometimes."

            "This has been such an unenjoyable course. Lectures are Prof. S's own personal soapbox, and they don't relate at ALL to what you end up being tested on for the midterm and the final. I feel bad for potential comm majors that take this as a first course, because this is such a bad reflection of other courses offered for the major. This class sucked.", 
            "I actually didn't think Shazia was as bad as everyone said she was. She's not great and does push her feminist agenda on people, but overall I found the class interesting. Most people don't show up to lecture, but if you go to all the lectures, you'll get at least a B. Discussion was horribly boring though.", 
            "Shazia is so boring and it seems like she never has a point when she talks (unless she is pushing her femenist ideas onto everyone). Its ridiculous. Class topic is great, professor is not.", 
            "Shazia is a terrible professor. She constantly loses her train of thought and has no idea what she's talking about. I do not recommend taking this class unless you absolutely have to.", 
            "Shazia's Comm101 class was not enjoyable, lecture is very boring and uninteresting despite some interesting material, and she pushed her feminist agenda on her students. Grading depends on the GSI but the guidelines for the papers are unclear", 
            "The class is boring about 70% of the time I show up. She goes on a ton of tangents and pulls the race/gender card out a ton. I'm a liberal and even she was a bit overwhelming at times. Sriram Mohan was my GSI. I really like his personality and I learned a ton in discussion. He def grades tough though. The finals can be deceptively difficult.", 
            "Sriram Mohan was by far the worst GSI I have ever had. He was self-centered and extremely egocentric. Do not get Sriram as your GSI and if you do good luck with getting above a B on anything. Shazia was okay, but very boring. Comm101 is the most ridiculous class at this school and I do not recommend it.", 
            "My opinion(same as others'): Don't take it unless you need to for your major. You would expect it to be easy and the material is in fact easy. The class is made to be way harder than it should be on top of being overly boring. Easily the class I regret taking the most. GSI Sriram Mohan was condescending and an unnecessarily hard grader.", 
            "She's a pretty good professor. Lectures can be boring though and grade is dependent on 3 papers and 2 exams.", 
            "Good professor. Very nice and cares about students. Lectures weren't always the most exciting. Technically supposed to do reading before each lecture but I never did since she basically covers all material in the lectures anyway.", 
            "Shazia would be good, but she doesn't seem to put a lot of work in the class towards the end. Shows a lot of clips, lectures are pretty boring, and she just doesn't seem interested. Also took about a month to get our exam grades back.", 
            "Most boring college class I've ever had to take (and I'm a junior), and a class where most students get a B.", 
            "Honestly, Shazia's a very nice person but she is such a boring lecturer. The subject matter is interesting but presented in a horribly boring way. If you are interested in mass media , take the course, but be warned: You're going to have to work hard for an A. Also, PICK YOUR GSI CAREFULLY. He/She will make or break your grade in the class!", 
            "Do not take this class if you are not a communications major. Your interest will not be there and you need interest to survive the lectures. Not hard work wise, you don't need to do the readings really and there's only three essays. Study for exams early because there's a lot of terms.", 
            "Shazia is very organized, opinionated and on top of her stuff. That being said, she can sometimes be a lot to handle & she tries to get through an overwhelming amount of slides each lecture. The class wasn't that hard but lecture was pretty boring. Grading depends mostly on your GSI. The content was actually interesting but presented poorly", 
            "I had really high hopes for this class, potentially hoping to major in comm, but it has been very dissappointing. Prof Iftkhar is very liberal and feminist, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but she throws it at you. Papers are graded hard and vaguely prepared for, yet determine most of your grade, exams have no curve, class avg was in the 60s", 
            "I wish I hadn't taken this class. Shazia is very disorganized and her slides are not helpful what so ever. The lectures are extremely long and half the class doesn't even show up (the half that does is asleep). Grading depends on your GSI, mine was pretty tough. Tests are all on terms and there are A LOT. Even if you know them all its kinda tough.", 
            "super understanding if you have extenuating circumstances, she's very easy to talk to, very passionate about her job, overall a really great class", 
            "I love Prof. S. She's interesting and approachable - I've come up to ask her questions after class, and she clarifies, and is friendly whereas some of my other professors have been arrogant one-on-one (it is Michigan, after all). Has been very easy, but this has to be my favorite class due to her enthusiasm and the interesting subject material.", 
            "She's a feminist but I wouldn't say she's an \"over the top liberal\" like some said. I think some people just aren't used to talking about certain topics like objectification & appropriation. Overall, not a bad class, not a bad prof either. Easy class. 3 papers&2 exams. Some of the GSIs are incredibly tough though, especially since it's a 101 class."

            "Sabine really cares about all of her students and want's to make sure they do well. She was definitely the best professor I've had for french, and I actually began to enjoy going to her class. While she has high expectations for her students, she really does want you to do well. I would undoubtedly recommend taking a class with her.", 
            "Great instructor, knows a lot about cultural topics in Paris because she is Parisian. Very willing to work with students if there are issues outside of the classroom like work, other classes or family stuff, but definitely expects students to be on top of what is on the schedule. Also helpful in planning my major and study abroad in France", 
            "Sabine is such a caring, wonderful person. For 101, participation is essential and she will really mark you down if you don't speak up in class. Gives homework everyday but it's not a bad work load. Her teaching is interesting and she's funny also. Would recommend her to anyone who wants to start French.", 
            "She was not super organized and took a long time to grade. In general, the assignments were numerous and tough, but you do learn a lot.", 
            "Absolutely loved Sabine. She definitely went rogue from the course pack which I didn't mind at all. Her topics were always so interesting and she's very passionate about teaching. She's not the easiest grader, but it was never unreasonable. I always felt like I deserved the grade she gave. Your French will improve tremendously with her.", 
            "Discussion topics are interesting, and she isn't a horrible grader. That said, daily assignments felt very tedious. Participation seems to be based on her opinion of you.", 
            "Great teacher, bu you have to put in a lot of work. You might not get the best grade in her class, but you will definitely get a better grasp on French. You'll learn grammar and sentence structure better with Sabine than anyone else, but you'll have to learn all the vocab, verb tenses etc. on your own. Highly recommended if you want to learn.", 
            "DREADFUL. I adored French last year but she's making class really difficult, gives loads of pop quizzes and is ridiculously harsh/unclear on participation grades. She's often insensitive to our needs especially if the ENTIRE class bombs a quiz. Take another teacher who actually explains things better & save yourself the headache!", 
            "hard grader, but worthwhile class", 
            "I love Sabine. French 232 isn't the easiest class, but she is the nicest professor. She cares about you as a person and will help you with anything you need. Always there to answer emails or meet in her office. Try to get her as a teacher.", 
            "Great teacher. Sucks to have a language requirement but Sabine is extremely available and fair. You must attend class and must study. The workload is pretty heavy but you certainly learn a lot.", 
            "Best French teacher I've ever had. Her French was incredibly easy to understand, and her voice is beautiful. She tailors the class to fir the needs of the students, and isn't afraid to speak English occasionally to get the point across (or to tell a joke). Her class made me want to continue with French, something I hadn't even considered before.", 
            "Sabine is one of the best French instructors I've had. At the beginning, I HATED French after 231, but now I love it. She's tough, but once you understand her system, she's not that hard. She really wants you to do well in the class and is extremely understanding. I almost considered 235, and that's saying a lot.", 
            "I hate french, however, Sabine made it more bearable and I didn't DREAD going to French like I did everyday in 231. She is extremely easy to understand; her french is beautiful. She returns assignments very slowly and is a hard grader but extremely accessible during office hours and truly wants her students to succeed. Definitely have her if you ca", 
            "A really great prof. See works hard to make sure you understand and will always meet with a student after class. She really cares about her students and wants you to do well. She expects a lot, so make sure participate in class and do your work.", 
            "She was amazing, even though I didn't recieve an A Sabine was very helpful in class and at her office hours. She is funny and always makes class enjoyable to go to even when you have her for 2 hours a day 4 days a week. If you can get her as a French teacher I highly recommend it. Her grading policy is very fair as well.", 
            "Sabine is great. Not only is her french beautiful (it sounds like a song!) but she is so helpful.", 
            "I really did not enjoy my class with her. She was out for surgery for part of the semester and did work hard to make herself available during the absense but outside of that, she was not helpful. I could never figure out how she was grading, she got assignments back unbelievably slowly, and she never even answered us about participation grades.", 
            "Sabine is an awesome teacher. In my class she didn't randomly call on students, which was a huge relief to me. She is extremely helpful, and very prompt at email responses. She made French fun for a class that I had despised for the previous 3 semesters. If possible, definitely get Sabine because you will not regret it", 
            "Sabine is a great teacher and a wonderful person. She really helps students out in office hours and she does not make you feel stupid. Good french teachers at U of M are hard to find, so I recommend taking Sabine! You won't regret it."

The class isn't easy, but that's due to the curriculum covered. She does not speak English in class at all, which was a hard adjustment for me but it's gotten a little easier to understand.", 
            "Prof Larrotiz is the kindest person. She's very animated in class & is really approachable. She readily answers any questions you have & doesn't get angry if you ask for a definition in English (some Profs do). She does leave pretty vague grading criteria, but the exams are made by the Spanish dept. Only con is that her office hrs are only at 8am.", 
            "WORST professor I have had. She offers no feedback, and grade criteria is so random. I hate this class, and I cannot believe this woman is able to teach a class. AVOID at all costs . Take someone else.", 
            "Good professor, very nice and approachable. She truly wants you to do your best but if you get behind (like I did) you'll have a rough(er) time catching up due to the pace of this course and the daily assignments/homeworks.", 
            "This class was a lot of work, but Professora Larrotiz was very nice and approachable. She was one of the sweetest teachers I have had. There are homework assignments every night, but it is not too bad if you stay on top of it. It was an interesting course and I learned a lot!", 
            "Profesora was a great teacher and extremely kind. It's like any language class, you have to participate and stay on top of assignments in order to pass.", 
            "Profesora was such a great teacher and extremely kind. It's like any language class, so you've got to participate and stay on top of assignments in order to pass.",

            "Seemingly everyday, she assigned us to pairs and would either have us review the homework that she made us do EVERY DAY out of the book, in addition to the workbook section that is due before every exam and the four 250 word diary entries throughout the semester, or, give a short lecture about the new grammar.", 
            "Expect homework every night. She is a very tough grader, and does not give super helpful answers when you ask a question. Although, her classes are very interesting and I did learn a lot in this course.", 
            "She is a nice lady, though her class was tough. I had taken a year off Spanish and it definitely hurt me, but when I went to office hours, she wasn't very helpful. She would just say \"practice in the blue books\" or \"do the online homework\" and I'd just be dumb-struck that she didn't have any better advice or outside sources for me to practice on.", 
            "I dreaded going to this class. There is a ton of busy work that didn't really help me much. She goes over things really fast so you have to do most learning of grammar etc. outside of class. Participation is important, but if you don't have the right answers or can't keep up with the pace of the class, you feel dumb and its hard to participate.", 
            "Professora is wonderful. She's incredibly helpful and will spend a lot of time making sure you understand. I began the year with poor grades because I didn't understand the language well, but with her teaching ended up with an A. I took her for 232 also because I liked her class so much. DEFINITELY PARTICIPATE. She's a hard grader on participation.", 
            "Great Teacher. She's enthusiastic and helpful towards students. If you have the opportunity to take her class, I strongly suggest it!", 
            "Isabel was a great teacher. She was so helpful and I loved taking Spanish with her. The class was not super easy, but the topic was interesting and she tried to help. She definitely helped making it through my language requirement a little easier.", 
            "A ridiculous amount of busy work. I honestly regret taking this class to fulfill my language requirement. She is a very nice lady but I felt like most of class was self- taught.", 
            "Profesora can talk really fast, but you quickly get used to it. Pretty straightfoward class. PARTICIPATE! and you'll do great. There's busy work but it's really not that bad. This was my fave class last semester! Busted out an A with no problem.", 
            "Isabel is a very nice teacher. She tries to get everyone involved in class so you learn a lot. There was a lot of work, but you would get a good grade if you did all of it. Probably the best Spanish teacher I ever had.", 
            "Isabel was an amazing teacher. She is extremely kind, helpful, and fair in grading. I recommend taking her subject class- spanish women who made history. The work load is manageable compared so some other 232 classes. Consistent and frequent participation is a good way to get a good grade in the class! She really appreciates effort and enthusiasm.",

This class is pretty chill; the papers were the only slightly annoying part if you've never taken art history before. Otherwise take any class with Howard you'll benefit from it.", 
            "Prof. Lay is a really laid back guy who I genuinely enjoyed as a professor. The lectures were just long and dry. Grade based on 2 exams and a paper. The paper is super ambiguous though and expectations weren't very clear.", 
            "He gives the best lectures which are extremely helpful if you want to better understand the topic. He's also very reasonable grader, however you still have to show your work. There're 3 in class tests mainly testing your understanding of artists, art, and historical theme. If you show up in class and do the reading, they're pretty straightforward.", 
            "Amazing guy. He's clearly knowledgable on the topic and seems to understand the plight of the student. All the readings are more or less optional, and there's not much of it to begin with, but he covers everything in his lectures clearly and thoroughly. I would love to just grab a beer with him and listen to his weird stories and theories.", 
            "Professor Lay is amazing. I actually started crying on the last day of lecture because he was that good. Really passionate about the subject, and would recommend to anyone even if you aren't interested in Art History. Also, pretty easy A.", 
            "Prof Lay brings specific genius to this course, and generously shares it. He checks to keep the class with him, and outlined not just a history of 19th century France, but how it relates to life now. You get a sense he really cares. Every session made me laugh and think. He ought to have an endowed Chair. Great storyteller. Awesome.", 
            "Howard Lay is one of the best professors at Michigan. He is truly passionate about his field and even though I am not an Art History major, I genuinely enjoy going to his lectures because every time I come out of it with an appreciation for the topic. The class is not intensive but your entire grade is through essays and GSIs do all the grading.", 
            "I absolutely loved this class and Prof. Lay. He makes the lectures really interesting and clearly not only loves what he teaches, but is an expert in his field. Alex as my GSI was also really helpful and easy to talk to. I would recommend this class even if you're not that interested in art history. It will change the way you look at art.", 
            "Professor Lay was amazing! He's a very intelligent man and does a great job integrating historic events with appropriate works of art and social theories, but he breaks it down in a simple way so you aren't lost. Go to his office hours if you can, even just to chat - he's an interesting guy and very nice. Also you get a field trip. TAKE THIS CLASS!", 
            "Professor Lay was amazing. He is very engaging and he knows what he is teaching. If you approach him personally, he will help you in all means. There was one girl in my class who wanted to do Degas' dancers but she couldn't go to any museum that had one so he helped her out by suggesting places. The grading isn't too bad for this class.",

            "Literally one of the best professors I've ever had. You barely need to study for his class because his lectures are so engaging that you'll find yourself just paying attention and remembering what he says. He weaves art history into a narrative with punctuations of pieces and historical moments to tie everything together. Truly an awesome class.", 
            "Lay is a truly great professor. As I'm already interested in art history, it's not hard to be engaged in the lectures, but he lectures in a way that makes you even more passionate about the subject. I also love my GSI, Alex Fraser. Tests are easy if you study. Grading really isn't too harsh but only take the class if you're into art history.", 
            "He is the reason I got into writing. Being a dyslexic I struggled with my writing until taking a Contemporary Modes of Interpretation class from Professor Lay. By the end of the semester he awarded me an A- for that amount of improvement and hard work I put in. He values hard workers and those that constantly improve and revamp their writing.", 
            "Prof Lay presents the material very well and makes the subject matter interesting. However the reading was dense and boring and the GSIs did all the grading and graded pretty hard. We went on a field trip which was awesome and then had to write a paper on a painting we saw. Interesting class, but would not recommend unless you're an HistArt major.", 
            "Professor Lay is arguably one of the best teachers at Michigan and definitely the best in the art history field. Taking notes during lecture is mandatory and the exams aren't too bad. NOT at all an easy A but definitely manageable. Three non cumulative midterms and a 6-8 page final paper on a painting of your choice.", 
            "Prof Lay is an amazing teacher. He is interested in what he teaches so the lectures are interesting as well. Taking notes in lecture is essential, (plus there are pop quizes), but texts on ctool and the discussion sections don't matter. It's not too hard at all. Take this class and don't think twice.",

He just speaks, often goes on tangents, and doens't dialogue, or even lecture, but speaks to himself. Exasperating. Put me asleep. Learned all from my readings.",

I imagine that those freshman felt that Ian was \"condescending\" or got \"too angry about social inequality\" because they are either ignorant or didn't pay attention.

            "Worst class at the U of M. I don't know how anyone below liked it. Too much useless, uninteresting reading. Only take this class if you actually care about social inequality (i.e. why we can't get ahead b/c of our race). That's all it's about. Robinson often gets angry for no reason. If people don't pay attention, just accept it and move on.", 
            "Not very interesting", 
            "I truly enjoyed this course. Years later, I still think about the field study and what I learned from this course. I wish I could've contributed more to discussion though! Even though I did the reading, some of the economy articles were over my head, and seemed to be a bit advanced for the rest of the class too. Fair grader, good person", 
            "Lectures are long and boring even if you like the material plus you spend most of the time frantically copying down notes (although with a couple weeks left he made the slides available after class). He's very biased (liberal) and gets mad at students if they leave class early or do something he finds inexcusable. Too many readings as well.", 
            "Robinson is incredibly (and unjustifiably) condescending, and biased to a fault. Readings are long and not helpful. Lectures consist of frantically scrambling to copy down incoherent notes.",

            "Robinson is a really good prof. I wasn't too excited about the topic of this class at first but it proved to be really interesting and eye opening. Not too difficult, just a decent amount of reading. His lectures are pretty interesting, though sometimes they echo the readings. I'd definitely recommend him as a prof, and the class was great too.", 
            "Race and Class in Detroit--great class! Really makes you think about social status. Provoking for someone from the metro area. Definitely my favorite class in all four years at UM! Ian is well-educated and articulate.", 
            "Since he was a supervisor, Ian rarely had any direct contact with the class. However, near the end of the semester, he assigned us our final paper. Throughout the final process of writing it, he is always available and willing to meet and discuss with you. Also, not a harsh grader, because he values ideas and thoughts over grades."

Readings are excessively long but you don't really have to do them. All that said, super easy class with 40% of your grade coming from participation in section", 
            "AMCULT 204 was very easy, and I kind of learned some stuff, but basically none of it was due to Professor Von Eschen. There are 3 assignments the entire year, graded by your GSI, so you really want good GSI. 40% of grade is participation in discussion, so go to disc sessions. Good idea to do the readings or at least parts of them too.", 
            "This was just a bad class. Readings were completely unmanageable and the paper assignments were unreasonably vague. The material should have been interesting but the way she presented it was confusing and meandering. I think she only finishes like half her sentences. I feel sorry for the GSIs.", 
            "Professor VonEschen is the worst lecturer I have ever heard. She has had at least 6 guest lecturers, including both GSI's and they were more knowledgeable than her. Her lectures drag on forever and she can never finish a sentence. She says um more than any person I've ever heard. The class isn't easy either, I wouldn't take this class....waste", 
            "There is a reason that attendance is mandatory in this class, mostly because literally no one would go if it wasn't.

            "I think this is a great professor. She's quirky, definitely, but she's also brilliant, and in my opinion that makes it all good. She's definitely liberal, but I liked hearing a perspective on American history that didn't just echo what we see on PBS specials. I don't find that threatening.", 
            "The only redeeming thing about this class is that we got to watch many film clips. The teacher lectures on and on and on, and if it wasn't for the GSI half the class would still be confused as to the topics.",

You can tell he's passionate about what he teaches.",

Most of it is plot summary or pointing out themes and motifs that would be obvious to anyone who has taken a class involving literary analysis before. After a while I stopped going, but that had more to do with the 9 am timeslot than anything else.", 
            "90% of his lectures are plot summary and don't offer much insight into the books. While every once in a while his lectures are very helpful, this doesn't give me enough incentive to go to every lecture, hoping to catch the one great lecture of the month.", 
            "Early lectures aren't bad for easing into the first couple of Great Books classes, but after the midterm, it's entirely possible to skip lecture and do well - the class is entirely centered around your discussion section.

Early lectures are great for helping you get your feet on the ground but after that he seems to waste time on pointless digressions and anecdotes.

In general, if you read, go to discussion, talk to your GSI and really try hard on your papers, you will do reasonably well in the course. While lecture can help you in doing this, it isn't absolutely essential.",

I hope he is able to recover from his current illness and media problems and return to teaching.",

Half of the lectures consisted of Greene rambling about his days as a lawyer and giving us vague advice for what we should do when all of us would enter law school. The exam questions contained mistakes, and Greene didn't even grade them himself.",

He rambles, and most of the time you have to make it up by reading the text. Don't like kissing up to profs, don't take the class.",

There were 2 papers worth 90% and you only really needed the book for them, not too hard at all. He is willing to meet outside of class though and brings in federal court judges for guest lectures.",

Greene is a Professor, regardless of if he has a PHD or not. I would think that your parents would be more upset to learnt that you havent learned anything at UofM then that they paid for this class.",

The key to eternal life is to wake up Monday morning saying 'I wish it was Monday morning forever.'\" Life-changing!",

There was zero homework, and you basically just listen to him tell stories literally the entire class. I didn't know my grade at all since he doesn't update Canvas, but I ended up with a flat A even though I didn't ace every test.",

            "Pedro is one of the funniest Spanish teachers I've met. He truly cares for all of his students and understands that class might not always be our first priority. The difficulties that come up in 277 are a result of department policy, not his policy. He does get off on funny tangents, but he has time to b/c there isn't much new material to cover.",

You can tell he cares about his students more than anything. Pedro's always willing to help. He's like that cool, hilarious grandpa you love to visit. Definitely recommend him!",

            "I enjoyed Pedro as a professor, but I was taking the class purely for my own benefit, and didn't feel that my Spanish skills improved at all, as there is very little speaking involved and you don't work in groups much.",

Not a hard class as long as you do the readings and talk at least a couple of times in class since it's mostly graded on participation! Easy online homeworks, no exams or quizzes, the final is a 5 page paper on any topic. Definitely recommended.", 
            "Gomez is awesome; 99% of the time, you'll have what seem like tangential discussions but they usually end up on the story we had to read, making us think about the story in a new way. You do have to study grammar on your own as part of the course, and apart from this you really should have a good work ethic.",

He does not follow the syllabus at ALL, he rarely tells students what he expects for papers so doing well is impossible, and class time consisted of about 10 minutes of grammar reivew & 40 minutes of him telling us how \"great\" he is. Just. Say. NO.",

Unfortunately, he broke his leg 2/3 into the semester and Prof. Winn taught us. (Winn was pretty good as well, but I liked Gerdes better). Watch the prelectures, they're extra credit and the pictures they use help.",

For the last third of the semester that I had him, he broke his ankle, so Professor Winn taught my class, and Gerdes was way better.",

Webb is enthusiastic and has a cool British accent, but isn't able to organize his thoughts into a studyable form. Frustrating to study for, and the projects are completely pointless and should be done away with.",

He's also tons of fun. If you're chill,you'll find him hilarious.",

            "HORRIBLE TEACHER!! His lectures are so vague and do not correlate with the book, so it's very hard to study for exams. His exams are too wordy, and everything in the class seems so disorganized. Usually in every class I can get a general picture of each topic we've covered, but not here. Everything is so scattered. Take Physiology 201 instead!", 
            "By far the worst professor I have ever had at this university. Do not take this class with him if you are wanting prep for the MCAT. Exams are very wordy and difficult to understand,lectures are very hard to follow--outlines are simply 5 typed pages of nonsense. Should not be allowed to teach this class again--very arrogant and not helpful at all"

She rambles on but the material is interesting only if you're into history. She is weird at grading but if you work hard on papers you could pull an A- / B+. Not a blow off", 
            "There's a lot of reading entailed with Professor Israel but I've never had a more passionate and informed professor. Extremely captivating lectures and interesting readings make the papers not too bad to write", 
            "I've taken a few classes with Professor Israel and I can't recommend her enough. A really smart and inspirational professor. She grades fairly and you can tell she's extremely passionate about the material. She also selects great books, too!", 
            "Use of powerpoint is on the low side and lectures can be a little on the boring side sometimes, but she's definitely knowledgeable and passionate about what she teaches and is very helpful during office hours.", 
            "Prof Israel lectures without any visual aid nearly every class. Extremely hard to stay awake sometimes. Assigns a lot of books that you need to cite in depth on essays, but I got away with finding quotes to cite online. She does keep track of attendance, so you do need to attend. She is very passionate and knowledgeable about the topics.", 
            "All lecture but if you zone out for a second you're in a different decade. She obviously knows a lot of material but drones on and on. So hard to not to fall asleep. Biggest issue with this class was my GSI at the time. Really socially awkward and unknowledgeable. Even if lectures are interesting, the grades come from her so she ruined it for me.", 
            "Professor Israel is incredibly knowledgeable. However, her political viewpoints are clear and you would be hard pressed to write any paper that didn't reflect those viewpoints. Also, the assigned reading, while interesting, conforms to the professor's politics. This made the class seem a bit too one-dimensional.", 
            "Scottish History. Professor Israel is amazing at constructing a historical narrative. Her classes were so worthwhile because of this. A lot of the information given in class was never used, but the themes were incredibly important. A lot of reading, but all phenomenal reading. I have three new favorite books. She is a must-take for history majors.", 
            "The professor was very insightful when you talk to her in office hours. Her lectures can be pretty boring because she has no powerpoint to follow what she is saying. Make sure you read the novels in depth to do well on the papers. If you are not very interested in British history, you probably should look for another class.", 
            "I really enjoyed taking British history with Professor Israel. The class was heavy on the social aspect of history and you'll learn a lot about the plight of the working class. Paper guidelines were fair and allowed students to think critically. Overall, not an extremely demanding class but it wasn't an easy A either. Be prepared to read!", 
            "Scottish history. The class met once a week for three hours, which was a lot of history at once but not too bad. There's a ton of reading though... one week she assigned two 300+ page books and only discussed them briefly. Other than reading, a pretty easy and interesting class. Three short papers... just be sure to take her side when writing them.",

Only 3 essays in total with no other assignments, and Professor Israel is happy to review and correct them before you submit.", 
            "Modern Scottish History. Interesting when not talking about religion or politics. Amount of reading grew annoying quickly, though I'm an engineer. Easy grading, but more short papers than the syllabus lets on.", 
            "Her readings, though extensive at times, are at least captivating if extremely depressing, and attendance in lecture is mandatory which is annoying but can make getting good grade easier due to participation grade. Interesting perspective but heavy on social history esp. working class and youth during WWI.", 
            "It was supposed to be English and History, but we never discussed the books in a literary sense at all. Her lectures consist of her talking for 1.5 hours without slides or any kind of discussion. She assigns excessive amounts of reading, that were then never discussed in class.", 
            "Professor Israel is an amazing professor. She is captivating and extremely knowledgeable. I look forward to every lecture. She delivers her lectures with a passion and a drive that lacks with many other professors. I always felt like there was a point to being in class. I looked forward to every lecture to learn more and learn with more interest.", 
            "Average professor, fairly undemanding/easy course. Lecture was very boring but attendance was always taken. I needed it for R/E and it was okay. Not too difficult but not a fun class.", 
            "Professor Israel is by far my favorite professor at U of M. Her lectures allow you to really get a sense of feelings, and opinions of the people during the time period. She made British History seem exciting. The class is based off of essays, and attendance, so it's not too difficult to get a good grade.", 
            "She made British history seem really personal. Definitely focused on the human face of history and the social context. Clearly a knowledgeable professor. Her class is essay based, so if that is your strong side, it should be fairly easy to get a good grade.", 
            "I loved her! She covered TONS of information and made it sound like nothing, made everything very easily digestible, and she was never boring. The readings are interesting and you will need to at least skim them for papers, otherwise not totally necessary. Really, going to this class was just a treat. Take her, you'll love it!"

He is extremely knowledgable in the subject and inspires his students to look at History in a way that I have never experienced before. There is a lot of reading to do for this class (one course pack plus 3 books) but it is definitely manageable if you put in the time and effort.", 
            "If you dont go to lecture, you miss all the information because he literally posts ZERO content anywhere. Mater of fact, he didnt even have a canvas page this year. Hes a very old school lecturer, no PowerPoints, a little rude.", 
            "Marwil takes pride in being a very tough grader. I took the class because the topic seemed very interesting to me (F'17 was 20th C. American Wars). Marwil is a thought-provoking and well-spoken, albeit rambling, lecturer. I regret not taking it pass/fail. GSI was cool this semester. Discussion section participation 20%, 2 tests + 1 paper 80%", 
            "The whole class is based off of lectures and readings. Nothing is online. Dr. Marwil's lectures are actually really interesting and engaging. The gsi does all the grading though", 
            "This class was a lot of work but so worth it. Professor Marwil is an amazing lecturer and picked primary sources that were relevant and interesting. He also loved engaging with students.", 
            "If you're willing to put in the effort, you'll do well in the class and learn a whole ton in the process. Marwil knows his subject and gives all sorts of interesting information, though you'll often need to read the textbook to get the \"big picture\", as he often focuses on smaller details. Be ready to participate in discussion, it was 30% for us!", 
            "Marwil is a very tough grader. The class overall is really interesting and he really makes you work. He says C is average and you have to blow him away to get an A. His exams are essays and he doesn't really give you much guidance and says to study everything (which is a lot). The matieral is good but only take this class if you're willing to work.", 
            "Probably one of the hardest classes I have ever taken. As an engineer, I needed a humanities class that I could get an easy A in... definitely not the case here. I participated regularly in class and read all of the books assigned, yet I found myself doing terrible on the papers and getting no help during office hours. STEER CLEAR OF THIS CLASS.", 
            "There is a ton of reading in this class. Luckily, the final and paper aren't based off of his lectures, so do the reading, and you'll pass.", 
            "Professor Marwil is brilliant and the information he presents is extremely interesting. You better pay attention or you will be lost in this class. He does ramble on at times, but if you stay focused you can get a lot out of this class. There are a lot of readings, but as long as you do most of them you can easily participate in discussion.", 
            "Everyone is correct when they say he grades tough and makes you read, but believe that it is absolutely worth it! His lectures make you look at history in such a new and thought expanding way. Take the class, work hard, and get the most rewarding B+ ever.", 
            "Not an easy class but a fantastic class. Marwil is a hard personality for everyone to love. His arguments are interesting, he usually has good GSIs working for him, the readings are interesting. I really enjoyed this class. It will challenge you. He will not hold your hand and yes you have to work for your grade. Welcome to college.", 
            "Very interesting and thought provoking class. I cried more than once while watching the documentaries. You don't have to write like a historian, just like a college student. I am not a history major and I really enjoyed this course, though the readings do take a while to get through", 
            "This class is honestly downright pathetically organized and will leave even the brightest of students irritable and feeling lost at any given moment. No organization of material, no lecture slides, and office hours are almost useless. My advice: never take any of his classes. You will regret it.", 
            "Professor Marwil is a brilliant man. His opinions may not be conventional, but they are all extremely informed. I felt honored to be in his presence. This class may have a lot of reading, but if you take the time to do it it will enrich your life and how you see the United States in the world and at home.", 
            "STAY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM HISTORY 266. YOU WILL NOT GET AN A. The lectures were great, but his grading is absolute ludicrous. I'm an A to B+ only student, and the grades i received did not mirror this at all. His goal in the class is to 'make you work for it' aka make your life an absolute living hell, even when you are working extremely hard.", 
            "Yes, this class was challenging, but it was by far my favorite class I've taken at Michigan. It's important to stay engaged and take good notes during lecture because he doesn't use Powerpoint. Expect a lot of reading, but you really only need to know a few examples for the exams.", 
            "Great reading selections but poor execution of class. Given no direction toward what to study for his exams. As a history major, I expected to write historical arguments but that was not the case. Most of the class was discussion so issues were raised but never satisfyingly resolved or understood.Grades on his opinion only not strength of argument", 
            "I took this class as a freshman in the Fall and the workload kicked me in the stomach. He knew a lot about the subject, but seemed slightly aloof when I went to his office hours. He doesn't use PPT, tons of mediocre reading, and your entire grade is based on 2 essay exams, a research paper, and your discussion grade. Take at your own risk.", 
            "This was a very difficult class. There were a lot of readings each week and your grade is only based on four things. The essays are graded very difficultly so don't take this class if you're looking for an easy A. Overall, this was an interesting class."

Heads up: He digresses a lot but they're interesting digressions and you learn a lot about him.",

However (this is not his fault) the U of M Webwork totally sucks and is full of bugs. This issue needs to be dealt with ASAP.",

            "The class itself is hard, but he does a good job of trying to make sure everyone understands the material.", 
            "Nice guy who cares about his students, but very difficult to follow. Lecture slides are convoluted, and I relied mostly on the book to pass.", 
            "He really is a nice guy who cares about his students a lot. Many of his problem sets can be very difficult, his more advanced courses are probably not suitable for students without much math/proof experience. Not the clearest lecturer but he gives his best effort to make sure everyone can learn the course material.", 
            "Yaoyun cares so much about his students and their success. He actually took the time to meet with each homework group one-on-one to ask for ways he could improve the class, and then he immediately implemented many of our suggestions. The homeworks are extremely challenging, but we get the chance to solve interesting problems.", 
            "Despite all the flak he gets, I really appreciated Professor Shi's Enthusiasm. He really loves the class and he tries his hardest to make it a good experience for his students. Although going to his office hours can be confusing, he will put as much effort as possible into helping you. Even the class was hard, he left me appreciating it after.", 
            "I got an A for this class and really enjoyed his lecture", 
            "It's a tough class, and sometimes you can't completely understand Prof. Shi in lecture. I hate theory/proofs and thus I hated this class. Prof. Shi was a great guy, who was there for you and very reasonable with his grading and how he handled the course. It's not a fun class, but Prof. Shi is a very likeable guy and really wants you to succeed.", 
            "Worst teacher ever", 
            "He curves to a C. You might not believe it at first, but once you take the class you will realize that it is true.", 
            "He could not communicate the information in a way that I could understand. Only understood the first 14 of the class because I read the book, he added nothing to what I had learned from reading or what he did add was very complex and explained poorly. When the course got hard (last 34) I just had to bs the proofs... avoid if possible", 
            "He gets a lot of flak on here, but he is actually a pretty good professor. I enjoyed EECS 376 with him, and the lectures were pretty interesting.", 
            "Professor Shi isn't as hard to understand as everyone says. He is passionate about the topic and comes to class everyday with a smile on his face. He is a really nice guy, and is more than willing to help you. Yeah, he is a bit tough but to make up for that he does allow you to take exams home. He deserves more credit than he gets.", 
            "He does not make the (really dry) material interesting in any way. I would easily get distracted during lecture then be lost for the rest of the lecture. He is very helpful in office hours tho! I used the book to pass. His grading policy is such that it is really hard to fail the class tho, so that is nice.", 
            "Way too hard to follow. Don't ever take any class with him. Listen to all the people here.", 
            "Extremely hard to follow", 
            "Don't take his class", 
            "Yaoyun's class was very difficult, but he truly cared about the students and how well they understood the material. He goes above and beyond for the sake of his students' understanding. Do your best to get to know him one on one, and ask questions as much as possible (even about material already covered). He loves to help, very nice guy.", 
            "Yaoyun is difficult to understand at times, but he cares and works to improve. He is very smart and it was a joy to learn from him-especially at office hours. The class was difficult but very enjoyable. Make use of all course materials/resources and you will do alright.", 
            "His class is very tough, but I don't think he's the worst professor as many here would say. I did poorly on the first midterm and went to talk to him. He was very willing to help as much as needed and wanted me to tell him any way he could improve his teaching of the class. Good professor, tough class.", 
            "one of the worst prof at UM. very nice guy though. Beyond solvable homework as some of the problems were actually life-long research, expected us to be genius I think. Useless lectures, feel dumb after going and learn 99% from google (other 1% from discussion, yay). Avoid at all cost if you want your semester ruined."

            "Kind and passionate. Going in for office hours is extremely rewarding. Amazing professor.", 
            "Professor Pedraza is an amazing person. That being said, her lectures aren't super important for the exams. The only issue I have with this class is that their is very little clarity about expectations for the final paper. It is also extremely long (20-25 pages). The exams are very straight-forward and if you do the readings, you'll do well!", 
            "I agree with some others. Sylvia is well-meaning, but often gets distracted by off-topic stories and it is not clear what is expected during the test or the 20 page paper. doesn't communicate well with GSI. could have been an interesting topic (soc of immigration) but was not taught well.", 
            "She is very passionate about her Cuban history so she relates a lot of the class materials back to it. She often gets distracted during lecture with other topics. The GSI does most of the work. 2 Blue-Book exams and a final paper that only your GSI grades. She seems to care about the lives of her students. Easy course for race & ethnicity credit.", 
            "Professor Pedraza wasn't that bad. Her class, AMCULT 100-What is an American, was easy as long as you read the book and go to discussion. The GSI did all of the grading so having a good relationship with them is esential. Tests are pretty straightforward and if the class the poorly, she applies a curve. She also gives a lot of EC. Easy A.", 
            "Pedraza means well and is enjoyable to listen to, but the class had no organization or structure. The material was interesting at times and the reading was easy, but there was no communication between Pedraza and the GSI. While the class thought this was going to be an easy A, many were taken aback when exams were graded harshly.", 
            "Easy material, smart professor and super helpful GSI. Exams were pretty easy as well, and all the info on the lecture slides will guarantee you an A on the exam. Extra Credit assignments are a huge help on exams as well. 20-25 page paper is more of busy work than anything. Not difficult to do at all but she should've kept it at 15-20pages instead.", 
            "Nice professor and a great class. Yes, she talked about her life and Cuba, but it was relevant and relatable to a class about immigration. Genuinely cares about her students, and you can really pick and choose what readings you do to have material to write about on the two exams, which are essay exams. Definitely recommend this prof and class.", 
            "Lectures are extremely monotonous and do not reflect what is tested at all. Lectures always end up being personal stories about Cuba. Discussion was the only thing that was relevant or remotely interesting in this class. Easy A but extremely dull and boring presentation.", 
            "Prof. Pedraza is a really nice person in general, and I liked her outside of being the instructor. She is very interested in her students and their immigration history, and immigration in general. She kind of got off topic in lecture sometimes because of this. The exams are pretty easy: study guides, and you can get like 15% extra credit per exam.", 
            "Easy class! Just read the textbook, study the power point slides, and take excellent notes on all of the key concepts! Nice Lady too. Very soft spoken. Her GSI, Atef, is a real class act too.", 
            "Professor Predraza is very nice and very clear. However, after attending every lecture during the semester, I now realize going was absolutely unnecessary. To get an A in the class you really only need to look at lecture slides and do some of the readings. However, the 15 to 20 page research paper was not fun! The exams were essay.", 
            "The class is easy, but they graded it as though it was hard. Many students were mad at how the tests were graded. one student did get an A and just read the lecture slide,didn't go to class or lecture. So that was fishy. Its a complete waste of time & $. The 15-20 page paper was fun but that's it. GSI is terrible and useless. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!", 
            "Also listed as SOC304. Some of the things she says are a bit ignorant and made some feel uncomfortable. Don't need to come to lecture, but she does tell some interesting stories.. that gets annoying after a while. She's very nice, and very cute/fashionable for her age! Interesting topic and I like the way the class is laid out. Need a good GSI!", 
            "Slyvia was very passionate about the subject and did a great job keeping you interested. The class was rather long at 3 hours and the load of reading was very large. But, with that said she is very patient with students and professional", 
            "Two essay/ID exams, one term paper on your own family history, one disc. presentation (awful GSIs, be warned). While she has great knowledge, does gravitate back to personal accounts (CUBAAAA) and lectures move slowly. If I had to, though, I would gladly take this course again. Also, I love the way she says the word 'immigration'... you'll see.", 
            "Don't take this class. The professors lectures are useless, all she does is name drop her \"colleagues\" and tell personal stories that are not on the exams. My GSI was hard to understand. The professor is rude and not willing to meet or discuss exams. The class is unorganized, many misunderstandings between GSI and professor.", 
            "CUBAAAAAAAA all cuba all the time CUBAAAAAAA", 
            "I took Slavery, Genocide, and Refugees with her. Sure we were supposed to be talking about the Cambodian Genocide, but somehow we ended up talking about Cuba, AGAIN! All Cuba all the time. You will hear many personal stories. On the plus side, doing the reading is completely unnecessary.", 
            "The material has the potential to be very interesting, and at times, it is. However, the presentation of the material also tends to be slow and dull, which is unfortuante because I do believe Sylvia is passionate about it. BUT, she is very nice and helpful, and ultimately, I think she wants to see all her students succeed."

            "Personally, I love Prof Hildinger and all the side tangents he goes off into about his wife (also Dr. Hildinger) and their trips to Italy and his knowledge of Latin. I found that he could light up the most mundane topic. If you want a good Tech Com person get Hildinger (not to be confused with his wife, who also teaches TC).", 
            "I found Prof. Hildinger's Tech Comm lectures to be very informative and interesting. I can genuinely say I learned a lot from having him as an instructor. He was willing to meet outside of class with my project team, and his feedback was very valuable for both my projects and understanding of the material.", 
            "Prof is an ok choice for TCHNCLCM 300, a very harshly graded course (extremely difficult to get A, but easy to get above B). He is honest and funny, making the dull and almost meaningless course materials not as bad.", 
            "Prof Hildinger is nice and chill. He didn't really care if you are paying attention during lecture and explained stuff clearly. The TC 300 with him is not as painful as what I usually heard. However, this grading for this class is EXTREMELY TOUGH. I roughly see anyone getting an A.", 
            "Prof Hildinger makes sure to outline, from beginning to end, everything you need for each TC assignment in the class. He's an excellent lecturer who never fails to entertain and perform, not to mention his interesting personality: a fanatic of jazz music with a curious love of history and, of course, technical communication. Take his class. Do it.", 
            "I don't think you will ever meet someone who enjoys the english language as much as Dr. Hildinger. He does what he can to make tech comm interesting and he does pretty well. He gives good feedback on assessments and overall does a great job in class", 
            "He makes an extremely boring topic actually mildly enjoyable. He has a wonderfully dry sense of humor and an even better sense of fashion. I've heard he is a very harsh grader, but he didn't grade the papers for my section.", 
            "Dr. Hildinger has great dry humor. He will keep you awake in lectures. Buy the little TecCom book he wrote, and it's the handbook to getting high scores on assignments.",

            "Great Teacher!", 
            "Great guy, great teacher. His office hours are invaluable to getting good grades on tech comm stuff. He's very frank about what you're doing wrong, but by doing this he implies exactly what he wants. Very good sense of humor and probably one of the teachers most willing to help students that i've seen thus far",

            "Technical communication is all about writing EVERYTHING you can think of, relating it in some way or the other to what Prof Hildinger says in class. So as long as you follow the guidelines, you are sure to get points. An intelligent professor, but TC classes can get boring, especially if its an hour and a half.",

            "Without a doubt the worst professor I have ever had. Inconsiderate, rude, disrespectful. He has no interest in his students and write abhorrent exams. This is coming from someone who got a B+ in the class. Before taking this class genetics was my favorite subject. He made me hate it.", 
            "Just a generally difficult class. Exams consisted largely upon multiple-multiple choice, something seen more commonly in medical school. would not recommend unless it is a requirement for your major.", 
            "This guy isn't as bad as the previous ratings on here would suggest. He's arrogant, yes, but he's actually really funny too, and he really knows genetics. I found that he helped make a very dull subject interesting. This class is directly from the textbook, too... moreso than any other class I've taken. Just read the book and you'll be fine.", 
            "Great class! He's funny and extremely knowledgeable about virtually everything related to biotechnology. A very laid back course in which he is much less concerned about a curve. Two exams and a project, (not multiple choice A-J like 305). If you can't stay interested in this class you should not be a scientist.", 
            "Hands down the most disrespectful, dishonest, and inconsiderate professor at the University of Michigan. Hasn't got half a clue how to teach, and finds it humorous to give exams with trick questions and multiple choice answers A through J.",

I have seen him treat his staff the same way. He does not care about students. For their tax dollars, the public deserves better than him.", 
            "The pre-health advisors will tell you that genetics is one of the toughest pre-health classes, and it definitely was the case for me. These exams are written to trick you, rather than test your understanding. He DID drop a test and despite what most people say, he is actually very nice, and always willing to help his students.", 
            "Honestly, I thought he was really funny and taught well. The only real issues were his tests; they were proofread abysmally and many of the questions made no sense at all or had multiple correct answers. The class is still worth taking, though, because no teacher, no matter how bad, could ruin genetics.", 
            "Genetics is hard, but he does a decent job lecturing and is helpful in office hours. He blatantly refuses to give us practice exams after roughly half the class requested it by deflecting and saying he had none. Exam questions tend to be ambiguous. Not my favorite professor.", 
            "You get to drop a test AND basically get 50 free points from quizzes. Easy to get a B but harder for an A. Tests questions are either very easy or extremely tricky. Don't like lecture but hey, half the sci classes here are basically learn it yourself. Not as bad as ppl make it out to be.", 
            "This professor was terrible. He never explained difficult topics, just read things off slides everyday. The tests were full of tricks, such as multiple choice answers that were so similar. It was arguable whether the answer could be clearly one or not, but he was stubborn in the face of this, even though 100% of the students thought differently.", 
            "I would rather go through a root canal without anesthesia than take a class with this professor ever again. He tries to be helpful, he really does, but it doesn't work. Yes, there is a lot of material covered, but it would help if the tests were an accurate representation of the information covered in his lectures and actually understandable.", 
            "He's not great, but he's not the worst @ UM by a long shot. Tests are hard but that's expected: lots of ppl do get 100s. The few times I emailed him he's been helpful. Tests are hard but doable: quizzes helps grade as well. Not saying he's not the devil, just that there are worser devils than him at UM.", 
            "He makes this class far more complicated than it needs to be. The exams are designed to trick, not test you, and are full of errors. The entire lecture is him reading off about 50 slides really fast, so I really could not consider him a teacher. Be prepared to learn all the material on your own. I hated this class, and I love genetics.",

No consistancy in regards to exam difficulty and does not like it when students ask him questions; he is very condescending.

There is a lot of reading but you can probably get away without it? If you pay attention in class. I personally tried to read as much as possible and it definitely helped.",

I wouldn't say 103 and 104 are a joke because you find yourself learning SO MUCH, but it's very easy to get an A. Just practice the vocab, pay attention in class, and reread the textbook before tests",

            "Louis is a really involved teacher. He's very helpful, and will set up meeting outside of office hours. He will even push back deadlines. The assignments given are extremely easy, and you have way more than enough time to complete them. If you really need writing 100, I recommend him. However, it was an elementary class, so I'd just go to eng 1245", 
            "Take English 325 with Louis Cicciarelli. Louis's relaxed teaching style and funny personality are very conducive to learning. He made sure to take the time to get to know his students and frequently met with me outside of class.", 
            "Louis was a fantastic professor, and I really enjoyed this English class although I never really like writing papers. Very engaging and fun! He is very helpful in class and office hours, and really wanted to help all his students. I would definitely recommend Louis to others taking this class.", 
            "Louis was a cool professor, he really paid attention to his students. I would definitely take another class from him.", 
            "This is one of the few professors at this University I seek out. I am taking another class this coming semester specifically because he teaches it. Louis is incredibly invested in all of his students. I can't emphasize how much I appreciated his enthusiasm for not just the subject but also for the growth of the students in the class.", 
            "He is GREAT. Very helpful and he is a VERY funny guy. He really wants to help and will try to do so. He's so great that instead of requiring us to buy a textbook, he uploads the readings on CTools. Awesome professor. It is only my first year but he is certainly my favorite.", 
            "Louis has been the best professor I've ever had at this school. Im on my third year and I haven't had a processor as engaging and helpful as him. The only reason I had difficulty paying attention in his class was because I also had the biggest crush on him!!!!!!!", 
            "Louis is a great professor. He is a very friendly guy and brings a lot of enthusiasm to class. Highly recommended", 
            "Louis is awesome! Really cool guy that genuinely wants to see you become a better writer. Leaves great feedback on essays and gives students a lot of freedom when choosing topics.", 
            "Awesome teacher. He does a great job at giving feedback on your papers, makes sure you will become a better writer, and the paper assignments/readings are great compared to similar courses. Definitely take Louis, you won't regret it.", 
            "he gives great feedback on your essays, which is very helpful. he tries to make class fun and is a funny guy--definitely take his class", 
            "He's funny.", 
            "Coolest. Guy. Ever.", 
            "Absolutely great professor. I learned a ton about college writing, and improved so much. I highly recommend him, this class is very enjoyable, but you must do the work to get anything out of this class.", 
            "FABULOUS professor! Absolutely LOVED this course. Louis is extremely funny and very dedicated to his students. The last two assignments of the course were creative essays- something I haven't done since middle school and they were extremely fun to write. Not a lot of homework, readings were simple. No tests and only four essays. HIGHLY recommend!", 
            "He's a great guy! At first it seemed like he has favorites, but he's very friendly and will give anyone his time who wants it. Quirky and entertaining, laid back, and really easy going about deadlines", 
            "So I didn't actually have him as a prof., he just helped me at Sweetland for Eng 325. He's AWESOME though! He's so friendly and super, super helpful. Louis really helped me improve my essay. Next semester, I'm definitely going to try to take a class with him, he's great!", 
            "The writing assignments were clear yet broad, so any number of topics worked for them, which really added to the amount of creativity and personalization allowed. Louis is a riot, his grades are very fair, and he's always willing to help during office hours. I would absolutely recommend taking his class!", 
            "Louis is a great teacher. He is funny and spazzy and rambly (but it's always amusing). He enjoys discussion in his classes and encourages debates and conversation. He grades very fairly and is always honest, yet encouraging about your writing. I would defintely recommend him.", 
            "Louis pushes his students to go beyond their normal writting abilities and think outside the box. Expect to work your hardest, but in the end, it will be worth it! Louis was an excellent teacher and actually gave instruction on how to write rather than criticism."

            "Flipped classroom, so class is spent doing i-clicker questions. Youtube videos were used for homework lectures (about 20-30 minutes long). Riles makes it clear it isn't an easy course, but he is very helpful in office hours. He is a quieter, more reserved professor. Helps with coding extra credit.", 
            "Flipped classroom and numerical modeling (coding) used, unlike the other 140 lectures. However, the coding provides a pad to your grade and helps out a lot in the end. Riles is more of a quiet teacher but is extremely smart and has concise explanations if you talk to him in a small group or one-on-one", 
            "Professor Riles's class has a nice format with the online lectures, short Q&A; session, and then practice problems. The coding assignments were also great grade boosters and fairly helpful. 80% of exam problems came from practice exams, MP, and in-class problems, which made studying much easier. Finally, Riles's demos were extremely entertaining.", 
            "Riles is great. Thought the notorious python assignments would be awful, but they give a great grade boost and aren't too bad. Riles really knows his physics as shown by his involvement with LIGO. Overall, it was an absolute an honor being taught by this man", 
            "I had no problem with Riles. I really liked the format of doing online lectures and problems in class. He clearly knows his stuff and can explain things fairly well when asked questions", 
            "Sure it's a difficult class, but Keith wants all of his students to learn as much as possible. Keith's class has the highest averages because of the free Python grade boosters as well. Everything in the class is reasonable and with enough effort, anyone should be able to get an A.", 
            "You can tell that Professor Riles is really passionate about Physics. The demonstrations during lecture are engaging and the weekly programming assignments were pretty fun. He is a little quiet and reserved which can be confused for dryness or apathy but at least in my opinion he seems to really care for his students.", 
            "My man Keith knows a ton of physics, will tell you it straight up, and will expect you to know it on the exams. That's it.", 
            "Had him for Physics 140, Newtonian Mechanics. His section is also kind of weird because we did Python coding exercises, and were the only section to do so. So there was an additional homework assignment, but they were usually pretty easy and were like 15% of the grade. His section usually has the highest averages.", 
            "I absolutely loved Keith Riles. He was passionate and extremely willing to give extra help outside of class/office hours. VPython assignments are a piece of cake & extra credit is offered. My one recommendation is to thoroughly look over the lecture slides. That is where you'll find upcoming exam problems. Not all the slides are covered in lecture.", 
            "This classroom was a flipped. You watched daily lectures on your own and then tested those concepts via clicker questions in class. He drops around 5 clicker days, so you can miss some class. The videos were honestly not that helpful, he always made things way too complicated and it got confusing. The class also requires weekly VPython Assignments.", 
            "Very difficult intro course. Lectures are online and class is just practice problems, but attendance is mandatory. Only professor that assigns programming homework which is a nice grade boost but takes time to learn. Average test grade is usually a 60%. Join an SLC study group ASAP.", 
            "He seems like a nice enough guy however the style which he teaches has really taken the passion I had for science out of me and I am rather disappointed in his dryness with the material. Feels like first priority is his research and all else follows in suit. Strongly recommend a different professor if you're interested in science.", 
            "I don't understand what people don't like about Riles. He was my favorite professor freshman year and one of my favorite teachers ever. The class is very difficult, but the hard work is worth it to understand the interesting topics discussed. The computer homeworks are a pain, but worth it in the end. I would not change anything about this class.", 
            "Riles teaching method involving watching his lecture videos the night before and in lecture he just goes through iclicker questions, so its mandatory that you attend lecture. In my opinion, I would suggest Uher for 140. But Riles has python homework assignments that boost your grade which is nice.", 
            "Riles is a good professor who really wants you to learn, however the Numerial Modeling projects are extremely time consuming and do not help your understanding of the material. Beware of his tests--they contain normal physics questions replaced with programming questions and those questions are quite tough compared to other sections' questions.", 
            "Although his class involves programming that took extra time to do, he is a great professor and willing to help in office hours. His lectures are online that you have to watch before class and then you do clicker questions in class for participation points. The clicker questions and Python are good grade boosters because the tests are hard.", 
            "A lot of people talk bad about Keith Riles but I am extremely glad to have had him for Physics 140. I thought he was a very good professor, clearly extremely intelligent, will always help you if you have a question. Yeah lectures are just iClicker questions but it prepares you well for exams and makes you think about the problems presented.", 
            "I didn't like the recorded lectures. They were clear but if I had questions you had to wait until the next day to ask. \"Lectures\" consisted of answering iClicker questions. The exams are tough but if you do enough practice exams you can do well. The computer homework was super annoying but it helps your grade a lot. Mastering physics sucks too."

I found her exams harder than Chapmans for this reason. The class is doable, but I found the exams to be a little extreme. I strongly recommend taking the practice exams and re watching the lec.", 
            "She seems really intimidating at first but opened up as the class went on. She turned out to be pretty funny even though she's better at being serious. Great at answering questions and interacting with students during lecture. Very fast paced lectures, but gets material covered in timely manner", 
            "Gyorgi is very nice and a good lecturer. Please don't waste your time doing the reading, she's always saying \"your textbook goes too in depth, here's what I want you to know\". Anyone could get an A, as it really is just memorization. Make sure you know the lecture slides, and you'll do well. I find her exams to be more straightforward than Chapmans", 
            "Gyorgyi is a great professor! She is really nice and explained concepts very well. She was always clear about what we needed to know for the exams and they were very representative of her lectures. Would definitely take a class with her again!",

She posts 3 practice exams with keys which is very helpful. She also allows unlimited tries to get a 3/3 on the quizzes due before each lecture. Use Piazza, it helps!", 
            "Gyorgyi talks VERY fast and just reads right off the slides. I would rewatch every lecture after to retake notes",

Just pay attention to the lectures, she does a really good job of organizing them in a way that makes sense. Exams are hard because there's so much information to cover but they're fair. Just make sure to keep up with it", 
            "Gyorgyi taught the second half of my course (last 2 exams). She can be funny and presents the material well. very passionate about her work. All powerpoints end up online. Exams are tough because multiple choice are worth 4 pts each.", 
            "I took 172 with Chapman for 12 of the semester, and Gyorgyi for the second half. Compared to Chapman, Gyorgyi's lectures are very organized. She covers a lot of material each lecture, so make sure you're paying attention. My one suggestion is to go to office hours. She is extremely helpful, nice, and you can tell she cares about her students.", 
            "She's very approachable and her exams are far easier than Dr. Chapman's. Her material is more intensive and requires more effort to learn. However, if you put in the effort you will get a lot out of BIO 172 and do well.",

The class itself is just not an easy class whatsoever. Don't skip out on discussionlecturehomework points, no reason not to get full points which will really help your grade",

Make sure you get the \"gimme\" points where you can, by keeping up with the quizzes and getting full credit for lectures. I did well on exams, but neglecting those gimme points really hurt me in the end. There's no such thing as an \"Easy A.\"", 
            "This class is hard, but not impossible. I think her exams were much better than Dr. Chapman's, but her teaching style is very confusing. Her slides didn't really include any information so you would have to listen the lecture online over and over again. However, since her exams were much clearer I got much better grades on the second half.", 
            "Dr. C is definitely a better lecturer than Chapman hands down. Her PPTs are a lot more organized and pretty clear. For the people that say her exams are harder, it's not true. It's just that the material she covers is harder and a lot more dense than Chapman's. Put in the time, and you'll do fine. Overall great professor, kind and super helpful",

            "Krasny can seem a little cold/unapproachable at first, but once you ask him questions and talk to him some, he's really a sweet old man and he's willing to help. He's very forgiving and understanding, especially with many people getting sick and such this semester. TAKE HIM. You'll learn a lot from him!",

            "He was a great teacher, he was very clear in what he expected and was always willing to help if I can to office hours, I would definitely recommend him to anyone going into honors math.", 
            "Krasny is a fantastic professor - the material is difficult, but he goes through it and makes it easy to understand. His exams are tough, but doable. He's always willing to help out in class or in office hours, even if you have a \"stupid\" question.", 
            "Krasny is one of the best professors here hands down. His lecture notes are clear, he cares about his students, and his exams are simple if you do the whole review sheet he gives out beforehand. Honestly, he needs to teach all the other professors here a lesson so they can be more like him.",

He answers your questions patiently and thoroughly even if it is a dumb one. And I don't think the exams are really that difficult. If you pay attention and do the homework, you'll do fine on the exams.", 
            "Phenomenal professor, he makes things clear and has good explanations. He definitely knows his stuff and is very helpful if you ask him questions.", 
            "He is a great teacher. He wants to make sure you understand the material and will put in the time to help you with whatever concepts you cannot grasp. The exams come from the review sheets, but are still extremely difficult."

Not only that, try to conceptually understand every single thing.",

Her exams are extremely hard and she does not care about students at all.",

Only recommend if you LOVE bio or if you are required to take this.",

The exams weren't easy, but the material was straightforward so it was just about putting the time. An A is possible, but you need to consider this class a priority, which it just was not for me.", 
            "Get ready to read a pre reading guide, pre lecture reading, and pre discussion guide, each week. You should also prepare yourself for 90 minute lectures of illegible handwriting on empty slides that you can't skip that have next to nothing to do about the reading you did prior to class. Class is over structured in all the wrong ways.",

It isn't as math intensive as some other classes in the major, but he's such an excellent speaker and explains the topics so eloquently that your experience will be lacking without a class with him. There's a fair amount of reading, but it isn't too difficult.",

If you are a visual learner like myself, this class will be very difficult for you. Interesting topics and great professor, but if your listening skills aren't that good, maybe this isn't the right class.",

He has a mild addiction to crushed peanut donuts, and brings them up in every lesson; he's funny in a kindly grandfather way. Great guy, great prof!",

            "Made the mistake of taking this class. THE most boring class I've ever taken &way too demanding for group papers. GSIs are super tough graders who deduct points where points shouldnt be deducted &the prof makes the 1.5 hr class feel like 4 hrs. SUPER monotone. Also assigns HUGE readings weekly. Grade slowly dropped from an A to B (unjustifiably).", 
            "Ray is one of my favorite professors I have had in college. He uses the content of the course to inform the way he teaches, so it is a really interesting class without being stressful. Ray takes his time in moving through content, so I got a lot more out of the class than I do most of my other classes. He is clearly excited and knowledgable.", 
            "His lecture was boring to say the least. He spends twenty minutes on a slide with only one line of words. Although he is quite the expert in the field, he often digresses and repeats information. It is not necessary to read all the materials as they are not tested on nor discussed. Many of course concepts are not applicable outside of class.", 
            "I found myself very bored in his class. Its frustrating hat he doesnt put all of his slides online. He seems like a pretty nice and interesting guy, but sadly hes just not great at lecturing. He goes too fast to write stuff down and is sometimes rude when responding to students questions. Course topic was not interesting to me, too much psych.", 
            "I don't know why this guy gets such a bad rep on this site because I think he's absolutely awesome. He's a funny person which makes lectures more engaging, and he provides good examples that show how the material is clearly applicable to our daily lives. I'd definitely take more of his classes if I could. Plus the GSIs are friendly and helpful!", 
            "The professor and the GSI's are nice. However, the class material is extremely boring , redundant, and somewhat useless. The jargons can be very stressful sometimes. Would not recommend unless you have true passion in protecting the environment.", 
            "Readings are non-essential, lectures are long and boring, and loaded with jargon. The research that the material is based on is all from the 80's. Group project is long and EXTREMELY redundantfive 4-6 page papers. The exams are short and easy, so you will overstudy. You'd need a PhD to do the work for which he says the class prepares you to do.", 
            "Professor De Young spends a lot of time going on tangents about topics that aren't on the exam. Said lectures were \"optional\", but they're mandatory because he wouldn't post all of his slides online (lots of fill-in-the-blanks). Unreasonable amount of reading and very boring lectures. Would not take this class again.", 
            "For such an interesting topic, I found his lectures to be incredibly dull. I could barely pay attention in them, and I am a student who is typically engaged. There was so much \"optional\" reading material that practically no one touched the reading, which made discussions dull. He should have honed in on fewer readings and been more clear.", 
            "Take this class if you are interested in any type of psychology. I thought it was very interesting. A lot of the material sounds trivial, but if you give the readings a chance and really think about the stuff it is enlightening. Professor couldn't lecture very well though, but I never went.", 
            "This is a great class that everyone should take. The GSI's are very helpful and the professor tries really hard to help students understand the material. The class material is interesting as well. If you read and attend lecture you should be fine.", 
            "I really liked him. The material wasn't too difficult but he kept it fun as well. I felt like I learned more in discussion, at least more clearly. Stick to discussion, come to some lectures, read a bit, and you should be golden.", 
            "Engaging, inquisitive professor; more concerned with teaching and having students understand concepts than having students memorize and regurgitate info. If you come to lecture, do the readings, and make a genuine effort, you should do fine. I like that Prof. de Young had students to meaningful, rather than busy, work.", 
            "This is a great class! Everyone should take it because it changes the way you live your life and your study habits. Lectures can be dry, but the material is interesting and useful, and De Young is very knowledgeable. The GSI's are great and very helpful! Workload is fairly light and the course focuses more on learning than testing.", 
            "He tends to go on tangents, which often make lecture painful. The course material is interesting and you can definitely relate it to your study habits and life. It's not an extremely difficult class, but you definitely need to work to get an A.", 
            "He's Awesome!", 
            "Very informed, terrible lecturer. Class was easy and had bits of interesting material, but seemed scattered at times.",

He was really helpful when needed and the GSI's are great (I had Jason)!!! One of the coolest projects I did and it was really rewarding. Tests were super easy! Almost got an A+.",

            "This class was the easiest that I'll probably take at the university. All you have to do is pay attention and look at the old exams he provides to study for tests. If you are not interested in science but need NS credit, take this class. Bender does a good job of making scientific concepts understandable in lamens terms.", 
            "Professor Bender was great. This was his class that he started so he was obviously very passionate about it. It's a good science class for people who don't know a lot about biology. The material was very relevant and very interesting. I don't know how it is with the new professor, but I highly recommend this class.", 
            "Really interesting material. Great professor. Highly recommended.", 
            "SUCH a nice guy. Yes, his tests are confusing and seemingly pointless as relates to the material covered in class, but all you need to do to \"study\" is look over the lecture slides and take all the old practice exams. 95% of the questions come from old tests, which he posts on CTools at the beginning of the semester.", 
            "Very disappointing class. The topic and information has so much potential and Bender butchered it with simplistic explanations and random questions on exams. He focused on the minute (ie llamas=indigenous to the Americas) rather than the overall relevance (the link between domestication and sickness). This made exams frustrating. Horrible class.", 
            "It's not that the material he covers is difficult, it's that he relates it to things that have NOTHING to do with biology. Instead of giving you dates, he'll ask you what period in US History it happened in (i.e. industrial revolution, new deal, World Wars, etc?) tricky tricky man.", 
            "By far the worst class I have ever taken. Tests are in now way reflect what is taught and only measure your ability to memorize random facts and numbers. He uses terms like \"magic\" to explain biological processes. A complete waste of time and not even easy to get an A in. Bender is terrible.", 
            "Terrible, terrible professor. Tests generally center around whatever random information he finds interesting and not biology. Some of his classes have a disclaimer that remind students that his material is oversimplified and not true. Tons of stupid history questions. Studying is essentially useless because irrelevant information is on the tests.", 
            "My boyfriend took the exam after I brought it home (yes you get to keep them afterwards) and got the same grade I did (3 wrong out of 27) without any knowledge of the material. They're not hard if you look at the lecture slides, but he does throw in random history questions :( By the way--first large animals in north and south america=llama. *shrug",

            "Don't take this class. Bender administers tests that just try to confuse students. You can study for weeks and still receive a bad grade because his test questions are so irrelevant. My guess is he an old cynical bitter man who failed his own bio class. It's not worth it. Trust me. Stay away", 
            "Professor Bender is a joke. He is extremely vain and not willing to listen to his students at all. I was very interested int he subject material but couldn't stand his lectures. They are boring, dull and at 8:30 in the morning. Bender makes a lot of rules that just aim to boost his ego and make it so he can do less work, and his test are impossible",

I did not learn much and sometimes regret taking the class. Bender's exact words, \"Am I going to test you on information that we have not talked about...of course!!!\"", 
            "Take this class if you're interested in infectious disease or microbiology. It's an easy A+. Bender is pretty cool, and explains most things pretty well. Don't miss lecture because he says A TON that's not on the slides. Good practice exams, but some tricky exam questions. Discussion is optional, but good clarification of material and reading help.", 
            "I loved this class, and I am not a fan of science. I really learned a lot about AIDS and other diseases (a lot of things that I didn't know). His test questions are kind of tricky, but the class is so interesting. I actually went to every lecture, he's really animated.", 
            "Professor Bender makes a 500-student, 8.30am class really interesting! His lectures are always easy to understand because they usually have a story-like format. He goes through the lecture slides pretty quickly (which has led to several early releases from class) so I suggest printing out slides beforehand. Tests are easy if you study."

            "I really like professor Diana's lecture. He is really funny and uses a fishing pole as a walking stick during class. I thought the exams were easy - they are essays though, so be prepared to memorize stuff. Everything is about fishes and he wrote the book for the class, which he gives you for free! Silly fish class.", 
            "Jim is the best teacher I've ever had at UoM, his class is very interactive and you will get to know him and your classmates, attendance isn't mandatory but he knows when you're not in class. He is very knowledgeable and easy to talk to outside of class. His exams are hard but very easy to prepare for, just read the book(its an easy read)",

If you're into this sort of thing, I guess it's not bad, but it's not an easy science credit for non science majors", 
            "WOW! This class was horrible. The material itself was somewhat interesting but the midterm and final exams were nearly impossible to get an A or a B on. Diana is nice and pretty funny but the class was too demanding and HARD! DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS unless you care about screwing your GPA up.",

            "I am baffled at all the positive responses this professor received. Everyone I've talked to hated this class. The exams are poorly worded and poorly graded and most of the GSIs are terrible. James seems to hate his students and want them to fail (review session minutes before the exam? C average on an exam for an introductory non-weedout course?).", 
            "Hilarious teacher who truly cares about the material. You will learn a lot about fish and will have a mandatory volunteer project. I had a terrible GSI but the other GSIs were great from what I hear. Definitely a class worth taking.",

He does give a lot of pop quizzes, but they're usually group quizzes, which makes them easier. I thought it was an easy class, but when I got to the exams, I didn't know anything and didn't do as well as I wanted to. Make sure to study!", 
            "His lectures are long and boring. It is really hard to pay attention. On top of this, as he lectures, as he says each sentence, he gets quieter and quieter until he ends the sentence in a mumble. He is already hard to understand because of his accent, and that just made it even worse. With that being said the workload wasn't really hard.", 
            "You can't understand a word he is saying so basically its impossible to learn.", 
            "You won't pass the test if you don't study. There are two papers and 4 tests. Sounds fair , but it's really not. While he tells you what to study for he doesn't provide any details or feedback. Your GSI will grade ALL of your stuff so the professor isn't really of any help, go to class for the power point slides though- and then condense them later", 
            "Very hard to understand as English is not his native language. Also, the tests are extremely difficult as there is as much information as a final in some classes. Lastly, the lectures are extremely boring.", 
            "Horrible teaching approach and so hard to understand him. His tests were really hard and I think his tests were more for tricking the students than to see if we actually understood the material", 
            "Such an easy class. If you got anything below an A, I would question how you got into Michigan. Most people treat it as a blow off class (80% Greek Life) and that's probably why they didn't get the grade they felt like they deserved. Kwak puts so much effort into his classes and is really passionate about the subject. Great intro to comm/marketing", 
            "Not as bad of a barrier as other people have said. All tests are straight memorization but a lot of curve balls. Went in thinking it would be an easy A but it wasn't. Don't take this outside of being a COM major", 
            "Professor Kwak is a really nice guy but just an average teacher. The lectures were only interesting sometimes, and I didn't find it hard to understand his accent. He showed videos and didn't give much hw which were nice. The workload isn't too much but it isn't an easy A. Only 1 essay and 4 tests plus participation in discussion."

Just 3 short papers where you reflect on your understanding of the material. He has some super interesting points of view and really expanded my mind set. Love this guy and would take infinite classes with him.", 
            "AMAZING!!!!!!", 
            "As a senior of UofM he for sure has been the best prof I've taken at UofM. The course papers are to reflect your growth and understanding of the materials. He makes sure you leave with a better understanding and he is always willing to explain and listen to your ideas.", 
            "Professor Aragona is one of the kindest and most enlightening professors I have had at this university. No other professor here cared so deeply about taking in the valuable material in this class, and applying it to our futures. going to office hours make it so much more meaningful. If you are looking for a class to think critically, please take.", 
            "Agreed with the last post. Professor Aragona is the most passionate professor and he really cares about his students and their future. He is the best professor I've had, a real \"O captain, my captain!\" kind of teacher. This class is a great combination of neuroscience, philosophy, and humanism.", 
            "Dr. Aragona is honestly one of the best professors I've ever had. Although the 230 reviews seem brutal (let's be real, 230 is set up AWFUL no matter who you take it with), he is so passionate about the work he has organized for this class. Be present for lecture, you'll miss important discussions - this class is geared towards changing our futures.", 
            "Worst psych class I have ever taken at this university. Honestly, worse than biochem or any other science class I've taken too. You will have to memorize every little detail on every little slide he gives you, which is like 500 per exam. He'll ask you about random quotes he threw in on the bottom of a slide. Learned nothing, crammed intensely. Dont", 
            "Look, I know you're here in hopes of finding one good review for Aragona. Alas, you won't. Really, there isn't one, he is that bad. Avoid this class. Take it next semester, just whatever you do, do not take it with him.", 
            "Dude knows his stuff but his lectures are a complete disaster. You can tell he really knows his stuff and is passionate about his work but the class itself is extremely disorganized and the tests require studying the slides into the ground, and revolve around memorizing inconsequential details rather than a comprehensively understanding material.", 
            "He is very friendly and happy to meet outside of class. His exams are difficult, but if you put the time in you will be okay. The last exam and final were more difficult than the first exams.", 
            "Brandon is a great guy but I had a hard time enjoying the class. Luckily he records them all with blue review which is super helpful. The tests are extremely difficult and not much thought seems to be put into them, at least three questions get thrown out every time for lack of clarity. He did not even write our final the GSIs did, it sucked", 
            "Worst class ever.", 
            "Worst class ever!! I have never been in a class that is so unorganized and graded so poorly here at the U of M. Tests are not designed to reflect ones knowledge. They are made to trick and weed kids out. I have plenty of background knowledge for this class but still felt lost. In my opinion avoid Professor Aragona at all costs.", 
            "Clearly a gifted researcher but terrible teacher. Probably one of the worst I've had at UMich. Tests are poorly written, Aragona seems disconnected from GSI staff, definitely not taught at an intro psych level. I don't believe the effort put in was equivalent to the grade recieved and the overall average was far to low for a class such as this.", 
            "While the material may be interesting, the class itself was really disorganized and did not seem worth the hit to my GPA. Coordination between the prof and GSIs was very lacking. This was not taught at an Introductory level, and professor Aragona should rethink his approach to this course. I do NOT recommend taking Psych 230 with Aragona to anyone.", 
            "Aragona is actually terrible. Sometimes I would feel like I liked him during lecture and then tests would come. Wasn't very clear on what would be tested on. Lecture slides didn't give much information. When you ask him a question he usually goes off on a long tangent and doesn't really answer the question. Lectures are soo long. STAY AWAY!!", 
            "Do not take this class.", 
            "I would change my major from BCN to Psych than have to take this class. This class is just so bad, words can't even describe it. Avoid at all costs. Exams are designed to hurt you, with C+ averages and no curve. This isn't how an intro psych class should work. Biochem415 had higher averages and a curve at the end. This class had nothing.", 
            "Biochem was easier that this INTRO class, do yourself a favor and avoid this class with Aragona.", 
            "Psych 230 is NOT an intro psych class. The subject material is interesting, but this term was the first time the class was exclusive to BCN and Neuroscience majors and it was horribly disorganized. The amount of memorization is not realistic and he is not very clear on what he expects you to know or not know. Take animal phys before..."

            "Best professor I have ever had! This is a really tough course, though. You need to go to office hours and attend every lecture to do well in this class. You're class notes are beyond important, as he doesn't use Spivak much but to assign a few problems. Highly recommend to take any class with DeBacker. Also, beware of 'Tom'!", 
            "He's a good reason for an undergrad to choose UM math dept over almost any other. He treats students with respect by holding them to a high standard. His lectures are exquisite: well-prepared, logically ordered, and very challenging. He may be the greatest of all time (GOAT) undergrad prof. I feel very fortunate that I could take 295-6 with him.", 
            "While he can sound \"mean\" to some sentimental minds, he CARES about students and or we should say, mathematics so freaking much! Even though he sometimes called my proof crap, I love him as my professor so much that I wanna take honor with him(but I miss it). His explanation and elaboration always gives me a-ha moment which books cannot give. GREAT", 
            "Told me there was a shower in East Hall after I told him I was spending too much time in East Hall. Now I live in East Hall. Good guy DeBacker.", 
            "Stephen is a great professor. Enough said.", 
            "Interesting but not really great at explaining things. The lectures go over things in contained in the textbooks, but not in as much detail or explained as carefully. I don't therefore see the benefit of the lectures.", 
            "Professor DeBacker is an amazing teacher. He's incredibly brilliant and great at explaining the material. However, he also has a sharp wit and a biting sense of sarcasm, so lets just say there's never a dull moment. Great atmosphere, would take again. WARNING: DO NOT take this course unless you really, REALLY love math.",

            "No review can truly do Debacker (God incarnate) justice. His love of math is infectious, his passion for student success palpable, and his brilliance unrivaled. These qualities manifest themselves in arrestingly compelling lectures that will continuously blow your mind. Its not easy but the pain is worth it once you realize how much you've learned.", 
            "350 characters cannot possibly begin to describe the greatness of Stephen Debacker, so I won't even try.", 
            "I could not recommend this class more to somebody who is passionate about mathematics. As Debacker himself once told us, \"Staying up all night doing math homework is one of the greatest pleasures in life\". There is a generous floor grade, which allows you to focus on understanding your work and putting in your own efforts rather than a grade.", 
            "Super interesting class. He always breaks for \"joke time\" which is nice.", 
            "The best professor I've ever had. He really cares about students and I learned a lot in his office hours.", 
            "Prof DeBacker taught us valuable life lessons in this class - apart from teaching us how to do real math, he inspired me to switch my wardrobe to 70% math tshirts and gives the best mathematical marital advice a college student ever needs (if I end up in a long, happy marriage and make bank with math, I'm naming my firstborn Stephen)", 
            "Professor Debacker is an amazing professor who really cares about his students. He's funny and willing to help, but if you don't go to office hours you are making a huge mistake. There is so much homework, easily 20-30 hours a week, so it's a huge time commitment. Don't take this with many other hard classes, and START THE HOMEWORK BEFORE THURSDAY!",

Tests get progressively harder because you have to start memorizing dates and species, but overall not terrible. Would recommend!",

            "His lectures were very easy to follow and he would sometimes go on rants about the applications of orgo to drugs/modern uses which was interesting. Do the entire coursepack and join an SLC! I wouldn't waste your time with discussion.", 
            "Professor Montgomery's lectures always seemed really well planned ahead of time and it was obvious he knew what he was talking about. I also felt that his exams were really fair, and even the more difficult ones were hard but still reasonable based on his lectures. He really cares about his students and I am glad I was able to take Orgo with him.", 
            "He is so nice and willing to help students. However, his handwriting is a little bit not so good. But his class is worth taking!", 
            "Orgo 2 is made to be a tough class, but Monte teaches it really well. His notes are prime and contain all you need to know for the test. Though he is monotone and can go through the material quickly at times, he really knows what he is doing and wants to see his students succeed. (Pro tip: Join an SLC study group for orgo.)", 
            "This man will do anything to help you succeed. Oozes genius and passion for chemistry, and it shows in the way he conducts his lectures. Literally all you need for exams are his notes and doing the coursepack and checking it with other people. Don't be afraid of orgo. I've heard that all of the profs are good but for me he's hands down the best.", 
            "Montgomery is a good guy, but sometimes his lectures get really long and boring. Don't bother to read the textbook but make sure to do the coursepack. Montgomery knows what he is doing but beware that there will be major parts of the exams that won't be covered until a week or less before the exam.", 
            "Montgomery is extremely hard to pay attention to. I stopped going to lecture about halfway through the semester and went through lectures on my own time and learned just as well, if not better. Chem 215 is a hard course as it is, but the dynamics of this class make it nearly impossible if you don't dedicate your entire life to it.", 
            "I took Monte for Orgo 1 and Orgo 2. He is very straight forward and his lecture slides contain exactly what you need to know for the exam and not much more. He has a very monotone voice and it is extremely hard to pay attention to him though. Overall, I am glad that I took him though.", 
            "Great professor! He was very clear in all of his lectures, and made the course very understandable. Little work was required outside of class in order to pass.", 
            "Great professor for a class many are less than eager to take (based on the subject's reputation). Class is taught in a way to inspire problem solving rather than only rote memorization. Professor Montgomery is always willing to help answer questions.", 
            "Montgomery was a good teacher, but if you ever got lost like I did, you ended up lost for the rest of the semester. He had a lot of knowledge, that's for sure. Sometimes he was way too in-depth for an orgo 1 class.", 
            "I took Orgo with Prof Montgomery and I found his lectures to be straightforward. He did his best to cover as much material ahead of time which allowed me to do more of the course pack ahead of time. His notes can be a little disarrayed, but if you attend lecture, they make perfect sense.", 
            "If you are taking 210 and Dr. Montgomery is on the list, make sure to have him. He has extremely clear notes and he writes down EVERYTHING. You will rarely be lost (if you are attentive and interested)and if you are, the amount of resources is endless. Follow his notes, DO THE ENTIRE COURSEPACK, and utilize the SLC resources and you'll succeed.", 
            "Prof Montgomery explains the material really well, and breaks down what you need to know to actually understand orgo and to pass the tests. He makes a lot of useful flow charts to sort the information you get, but sometimes it seems like he's jumping around and like there's no structure to his lectures, even though he's well prepared with notes.", 
            "Great teacher. Teaches every lecture with clarity. If you just go to the lectures, you'll know everything for the exams. Made me enjoy class and want to pursue more chemistry.", 
            "Montgomery was a very good professor. Tests were difficult, but there is not too much he can do about that. Really seems like he wants students to succeed. Last lecture there was a huge round of applause. I highly recommend taking his section if you take orgo 1", 
            "He explains everything very well. The key is to keep up because everything just builds over time. The course pack is essential. He doesn't have office hours but he is willing to stay after classes and talk or set up times during the weeks. Orgo is a team based class having study groups are helpful since there are no answers to the course pack.", 
            "excellent lecturer extremely clear and organized with his notes. He tends to go pretty fast, but if you can copy down his notes you barely need to be paying attention. they're that good. he and nolta probably the best professors for orgo 1. clearly a nice guy, wants his students to do well and is pretty funny too you don't need the textbook at all", 
            "Really organized lectures. Doesn't waste time going over material that wont be on the exams. Makes really nice summary tables and flow charts for some key chapters which was very helpful. He writes neat and at a good pace which means he is easy to keep up with.", 
            "I had Montgomery for Orgo 1 and thought he was great. It was obvious he wanted his students to succeed. His lectures were interesting and easy to follow. He broke down complicated information in a way that was easy to understand. I would recommend him to anyone who has to take this class."

I was able to go to Costa Rica, and if you're thinking about studying abroad to finish the requirement I would recommend it. Phenomenal experience", 
            "Michelle is absolutely incredible. If you are reading this and have the good fortune of getting into her Spanish class consider yourself lucky. She is an incredible teacher of the spanish language and an even better person. She has a natural ability in empowering her students and in turn your spanish improves dramatically. Take a class with her!", 
            "I had the absolute privilege of being on a span230 study abroad program with Michelle in Buenos Aires. I cannot stress enough that she has been the best teacher I have had at Michigan. She has the most infectiously positive attitude, truly loves her job and her students, and has a heart of absolute gold. Great at what she does recommend her fully.", 
            "Michelle is the best Spanish professor I have ever had! It's easy to see she loves what she is doing, and makes you love it too. She wants all of her students to succeed and treats everyone like a friend. You'd be crazy not to take a class with her. And studying abroad? Even better!",

Michelle is an inspiration, and regardless of how you feel about Spanish, you'll walk away from her class happy that you took it. Probably the best decision I've made in college has been taking a class with her.",

            "Hands down the best (Spanish) professor at Michigan. Always willing to go out of her way to help students. Understanding about conflicts (if assignment isn't done on time). Makes class fun and much more interesting than a lot of intro/intermediate level language professors. Take a class with Michelle, it will be your best class.", 
            "I can't imagine how a professor could be any better than her. Honestly, I can't find any bad critiques I wish she taught all my classes. Best language professor on campus.", 
            "I was lucky enough to have her for both 101 and 102, and she was very enthusiastic for both terms, very helpful, and really wanted you to learn the material. She does a great job of teaching Spanish; you will really know it like the back of your hand. It is too bad that she doesn't teach any of the upper-level Spanish courses...", 
            "Very enthusiastic every day of class!! Makes class fun and entertaining. You will actually look forward to going to class. Does a great job of teaching as well. Super nice and super helpful. Honestly, you can't find a better teacher!",

Even if you've never taken Spanish before, she makes it so easy to understand. She's super helpful and only wants to see her class succeed. If you pay attention and do the assignments, you will get a good grade.",

            "Prof E is very liberal, and even in a bio class finds a way to impose his ideas on you (specifically about breastfeeding), but other than that, it was a really easy class. As long as you attend lecture, and study what the GSIs tell you to, you'll get an A. It is useless to read the book because all his test questions come from his lectures.", 
            "Prof E's lectures are a little boring, but the material is very interesting. The class was really easy, and because of his policies, it is almost impossible to get anything below a B-.", 
            "Prof E is not as bad as everyone makes him out to be. He's out there, but he knows his stuff, and the class is pretty easy. I was definitely expecting an A, and got a B+, but that's just because his end curve is screwy. I liked his class enough to take his other class next semester though!", 
            "This class was a legit JOKE. lots and lots of busy work (i.e. bogus assignments/group papers) and silly quizzes in class. don't bother reading because the questions are along the lines of \"what vegetable was pictured on page 212?\".BUT, almost everyone gets an A. if you can make it through a semester of feeling like you're wasting your life, do it.", 
            "Practical botany is still an awesome class and i advise anyone who needs NS fufilled to take it. Prof. E on the otherhand, is a different story. Lectures usually put me to sleep and i thought i had that habit eradicated! most of the time he rambles about non-sense that hardly pertains to the class. The best thing about the class is LAB! WINE!", 
            "Prof E. is a kooky guy and is honestly a good professor, it's just difficult to understand what kind of answers he's looking for sometimes on the exams. If you study for 7-8 hours for an exam, you'll probably still receive a 60%. One good thing is he curves the class at the end and everyone receives an A or B, if they do the work + go to class.",

            "He puts really silly questions on his test. I feel there's more emphasis on tricking students than making sure they are actually learning something. The few times I spoke with him, I didn't get much help and I think he was just humoring me. He is not a good teacher. The GSIS were there but were unhelpful and kind of just there,especially Jess.", 
            "I was so excited to take this class and work in the greenhouse & now I totally regret my decision. Prof E's exams hurt my grade. I never knew what the right/acceptable answers were, though I studied a great deal. This class is \"hard\"/frustrating cause you think you understand the material only to be confronted by unreasonable questions. :(",

The material is interesting, and applicable to your life, however you do need to study a bit for the exams since they are all short answer questions. But still, all in all, the class is pretty interesting, and I really enjoyed Prof E's class.", 
            "the worst class i have ever taken. you could study and still do horrible on the test. the prof. was one of the worst - he would do daily quizzes to make students come to class, otherwise lectures are pointless. you can get an A just dont get fustrated that ur getting D's on the tests, that's just how this class is - STUPID.",

This class can be frustrating because of him but at the end of the semester he curves 30-40% of the students grade to an A and most of the rest to a B. Attendence = min. grade of a C-",

His tests are severly deranged you can study really hard, know the stuff backwards and forwards and still not do well on the tests! if you can avoid it, do NOT take this class! or take it pass/fail.",

I learned so much from this class and genuinely enjoyed going to class. I highly recommend taking a class with Professor Trevor!",

He tends to go on tangents, but they are always interesting. If I was an English major, I would try to take as many classes as I could with him.",

I regret not being able to take his Milton class, but I speak with him every other week. If you have any ideas, he will listen and help you become a better student.",

The digressions were probably my favorite part of the class because he explains things with an incredible enthusiasm for the subject matter. Class structure was really basic, and the requirements for an A weren't unreasonable.",

            "His passion and humor for the subject motivates students to engage in his discussions. He comes to class with a great attitude and encourages participation. He is a very fair grader. I am not normally an A student, but still pulled off an A-. Although the reading is heavy, there are only two papers, a midterm, and a final. Great class, great prof.",

Though I did miss some of the traditional poets (Keats, Wordsworth), Trevor made up for it with contemporary poets that filled the gaps. Overall a great course; grades weren't a problem.",

            "He is awesome! So interesting to listen to , and is obviously incredibly passionate about what he teaches. He gives a historical background to what he is teaching and gives us interesting facts, which makes the work more interesting. So cute too! Hard grader but worth it!",

He's human and 'normal' while maintaining an air of unshakable erudition. Be warned: He grades papers according to very high standards, but will also offer really fantastic advice. Do not miss your chance to study with him.",

            "Truly exceptional professor. He is certainly demanding, but contrary to these other comments, I found him (as did my classmates) more than willing to meet outside of class. He went so far as to invite us out to lunch with him and insist on 'Doug.' His intelligence can be startling, but never off putting, and he is hardly self-absorbed. Take him.", 
            "Great guy, great prof, and he seems to have changed a lot since his days at UIowa. I had no problem getting help from him outside of class. His grading can be a little rough, but it's what I expected from a 400-level course. I'd recommend both the class and the prof."

They're just old exam questions, so it's not like he's slaving over these things. A little scammy if you ask me. Only gripe though, so i guess that's good?", 
            "Coppola was alright. He tended to go fast during lectures, and only covered the most difficult material 2 or 3 days before the exam. Fortunately, Chem 210 has countless resources that help you. Tough class, but put the effort in and you will do well.",

Don't believe the scary things you hear about orgo; it's honestly not that bad.",

GSI's are sometimes useless, all down to luck, but you can go to whoever you want. 4 exams are all the grad",

It helps to read the textbook and stay ahead, as Coppola typically doesn't teach the hardest topic until the week before the exam. If you want to get ahead on the coursepack and have time to practice, it helps to self-teach and go to lecture as review.", 
            "I did not like him at all, his lecture notes were helpless. I used other professor's notes for exam preparation since Coppola's notes were useless since it's like a lecture for those who know orgo very much, his lectures shows that he doesn't care that much about 300-500 students per class.", 
            "Coppola puts chemistry into a greater context. If you attend his lectures / take notes you'll actually learn so much more than just how to pass tests. He is very passionate, very knowledgable, and really great lecturer. That being said, you have to put work in and know how to study.", 
            "Dr. Coppola teaches in a very technical manner, using scientific jargon for the plurality of his lecture. If you don't understand an earlier concept, he simply gets upset at the class and usually refuses to review the basics. You must come prepared to pay attention to lecture material that you have hopefully reviewed prior.", 
            "Prof Coppola is one of the best professors I have had in the sciences. He is very passionate about teaching and truly cares about if his students understand the material. His lecture style is great. He made a class of 300 students feel like 30 and found ways to make the class interact with the material while cracking jokes the whole time!", 
            "Coppola was a great professor. He was very passionate about chemistry which made me want to go to class and learn. He gave really difficult examples during class but it helped for the tests. Going to his lectures and doing the course pack were the most helpful to do well in this class.", 
            "Unfortunately, Orgo is the ultimate weeder course at UM, and everyone knows it (despite what the Orgo professors claim in their beloved course pack). This class has several absurd rules, to put it mildly- no answer key to the course pack, no partial credit on exams, and so on. It's incredible that there are no course pack answer keys!", 
            "Dr. Coppola is an award winning professor and cares deeply about his students. He has a very deep understanding of organic chemistry, his instruction is profound, and the course's exams are- never unreasonably, always appropriately, but still sufficiently- intense. With effort you WILL succeed, 70% of us got a B or higher so stop freaking out.", 
            "Coppola was a pretty good professor overall (especially considering the other professors at U of M). You can tell he has lots of experience teaching this class and he's a very good lecturer. The concepts are difficult and the class is pretty fast paced though.", 
            "At times his explanations can be really helpful, and other times they make no sense. He sometimes seems to forget we don't already know what he is teaching us and will often using chemistry vocabulary words without first defining them."

            "Super fun guy in his element, Professor Cassel knows his stuff and can answer any question you throw at him. Class is really lecture heavy, but he covers material thoroughly and you don't have to worry too much about notes. Tons of extra credit incentives to encourage participation; as long as you like the material you shouldn't struggle.", 
            "So it was Prof Cassel's first time teaching 204. He seems like a nice person and knows what he was talking about but its mostly hard to keep up if you have not done the readings thoroughly. He does not grade papers and has not told us how the grading is split. We finish in a week and have no idea where we stand.", 
            "Don't resister his course. Otherwise, you will face millions of quizzes, enormous reading with writing assignments. He has deep knowledge about Chinese culture, but he surely does not know how to express them. You will get confused and tired.", 
            "Cassel was a great professor. His lectures were usually on point, but sometimes were hard to follow without doing the assigned reading beforehand. The reading isn't really bad at all, even though it might be a lot. He's super helpful in office hours and more than willing to discuss what you've learned in class. Also, he's just a really nice guy.", 
            "Professor Cassel undoubtedly makes you work for the grade you deserve - you have to do a ridiculous amount of reading far exceeding what is supposed to be for the undergraduate level. The up side is that you learn A LOT - he is a true intellectual who is well read and are willing to share his personal opinion.", 
            "Par was a great teacher and pretty funny sometimes. His lectures are crazy informative so be sure to pay attention in class, he clearly knows the material. Tests can be a bit difficult but he definitely gives you adequate study materials. Overall, very worthwhile class and professor.", 
            "Lectures are very long and packed with high quality information, get ready to take notes. There are daily readings that are quite lengthy: DO THEM, they'll help out quite a bit on tests and papers. Study guides were given for both the midterm and the final; they have all the information you need. You will do well if you take notes and read.", 
            "Cassel is not the type of professor that understands if you have issues. His class is mostly focused on memorizing dates and names, which is essentially the entire lecture. I wouldn't take his class if I knew his teaching style.", 
            "It's clear that Professor Cassel is extremely intelligent and his language skills amazed me! He's very friendly and personable, but sometimes his lectures were a little hard to follow because he tended to ramble a bit. Overall, though, good professor. Would take a class from him again.", 
            "It's easy to feel intimidated because he's brilliant, but he's actually easy to talk to and truly care about students' success. Very calm and smiles a lot. Prepare to be blown away by his Mandarin skills. That said, lecture pace is almost too fast to take good notes, and the reading load is heavy. Still, I learned a lot and I recommend 354.", 
            "Took this class in Winter 2013. Par was a great professor but the class sucked. I'd love to take a class on China with him but until they streamline the 202 curriculum who knows what you'll get. If you have to take 202 do it with him.", 
            "Nice professor, but not a fan of the class- didn't get much out of it. 202 depends on who your professor is. For Par's section, grading is half on participation and half on writing. Close to half your grade is from one final paper so be mindful of that.", 
            "Par is a great guy and a fantastic professor, but the class itself isn't that great. 202 seems to vary depending on who teaches the course. Until the final paper all you need to do is a weekly blog. Class was pointless, but I'd definitely take another class with Par.", 
            "For being a class about doing history, I learned very little. All around bad class. He might be better for a class in his interest--China in case you don't know, but don't worry, he'll tell you about it as often as possible--but I wouldn't even bother.", 
            "Good professor but boring class. The content is bland and wasnt really interesting to me.", 
            "Great professor. Probably the best class I've taken at U of M.", 
            "Just an all around good guy. The class was a little intimidating at first, but he's a great professor. Ask him about Norwegian techno.", 
            "Cassel is so cool. He can be hard to understand sometimes but he really wants to help you understand the material so just ask questions. He's a great 202 section professor- focusing on his specialty of China. Lots of reading but mostly discussion based class. Take his class!", 
            "Very bad feeling after taking his class. I feel he doesn't really care about his students. Whenever I asked him questions, he just answered within one or two sentences. He didn't want to stay any minute after class. I have to admit that he knows much and is a Harvard graduate, which sounds good. But this class was quite boring in general.", 
            "One of the best classes I've ever taken - clarified my understanding of China and the PRC far beyond what I expected. Cassel was extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the material and followed up questions I had in class that he was not fully able to answer in class with informative emails."

            "Professor Goodman had a lot of diverse readings related to women in early modern Europe that kept the class interesting. Her lectures could be dry but most of the class was discussion. The looked at many aspects of the course, sometimes the readings were difficult but they were always interesting. If you do the assignments you get full credit.", 
            "Don't expect for her to actually teach you anything. You alternate between the classroom and a library every week: the weeks in the classroom are presentations and at the library a librarian lectures you. She contradicts herself in grading comments. Do NOT take this class back-to-back, the location changes and some weeks you're on North Campus.", 
            "Words cannot describe this class. If you are taking this to get an easy A, you should definitely drop it. Taking the class was quite an experience though.", 
            "Hard Marker. Shows no sympathy in marking. If you can, I suggest not taking the class.", 
            "Horrible professor. Tears papers to shreds without regard for students feelings. I doubt she's ever heard of the words constructive criticism. Instead of guiding students I believe she makes them feel miserable and stupid. Rants on and on about statues and such instead of helping us grasp and understanding of the material.", 
            "This class is SUPER hard. At the time I hated my GSI and thought she was too hard on me. But I walked away from that class knowing so much and realized later that they were pushing me because they knew I could do better, which I then did. No, they don't hand out A's. It's college. Quit whining about how it's \"unfair.\"", 
            "She isnt a bad lecturer, but she does tend to ramble. Also she is a ridiculusly hard grader, and will pretty much tear your paper apart, criticising your prose and writing ability, even if you are relativly good.",

If you want a good grade, don't do what she does, because apparently that's wrong. Otherwise, she's quite blase and her class itself doesn't really benefit your understanding of the subject.", 
            "Dena's lectures were a little dry, but the class wasn't that bad. There was a lot of reading and some of it was difficult to understand, but you had a week for each section of reading. Make sure you don't procrastinate with the midterm and actually put effort into the activism project, and you will do fine.",

If you're just taking it for race and ethnicity or a humanities credit, pick a different class.",

You're lucky if you get a good GSI who can help you understand what the lectures are about, but otherwise the midterm and final are so confusing.", 
            "This was the most awful class ever! The content of the class was horrible and the professor made it even worse. She just stood up there babbling none of it actually making any sense! The grading is extremely unfair, unless you share the same beliefs as the teacher you are screwed!"

No. But I promise if you put in the work and actively try to be engaged, you won't regret it!",

It was 1 credit but homework took 6-8 hrs to finish and her idea of a 'short' essay was 2k words which might be fine for an upper-level course but not a 200-level. Also, it was more a linguists class than a grammar one. Cool information, utterly useless outside the classroom",

The group projects are the main workload of this class. Hope you get a good group!",

I and other classmates all agree that we can only understand somewhat 20 percent of what he says. And his lectuers are very disorganized. However, it's worth taking once. Get him to sing.", 
            "Professor Chang is really hit-or-miss. His accent is pretty thick and is difficult to understand initially, and his grading sometimes seems arbitrary. However, he is an amazing professor and the best in his field. He's world-renown and has the knowledge to show for it. Do the readings and show up to class, and you should get an A.", 
            "Chang is tough to understand, has very high expectations, and can be a bit harsh at times. However, he truly cares about his students, and he really wants them to learn. He takes the time to make sure people understand how to write, and I've definitely benefitted from his efforts. He's not easy, but definitely worth taking a class with.", 
            "Prof Chang can be intimidating at first, but once you find a groove you'll be okay. You just need to know your paper's argument inside and out, because if you don't he will tear into you. Be prepared to get torn apart at least once during the semester, but he does it to everyone so don't take it personally. Make sure you read the books!!!!!!!", 
            "He can go off tangent during lectures, he most likely won't cover all the materials, and he can be hard to understand a bunch of times, but his class is super easy. A few detailed class outlines, a few book reports, and that's it. If you're lucky, he might even sing for you and take the class to lunch.",

His grading can be somewhat random too, so if you're looking for simple filler credits, I'd advise taking something else. But, when he sings it makes your day.",

Just be interested, try your best on the papers, and do the readings. His class was one of the \"easiest\" but one which I learned the most from.", 
            "Disorganized. Doesn't really teach in class and often goes off on some unrelated tangent. You are expected to write a bunch of papers based on dense readings on very complex issues from some ridiculously expensive books (that he wrote), but you are left clueless most of the time b/c the man does not know how to teach or explain the material.", 
            "Not only is his grading scale completely incomprehensible, he willingly admits it is arbitrary. He leaves no comments on tests, so you don't learn from your mistakes.

The books that he makes us buy cost A LOT. Also, he is a hard grader in the History 396 section that he teaches, and he is really arbitrary in deciding if he likes your paper or not.", 
            "A very bad professor. Classes are boring and pointless and the grading process is very arbitrary. He isn't helpful or comprehensible at all. To get a good grade in this class is like throwing darts in the dark hoping to hit the target, so in that sense a good grade is dependent on luck. Would not reccomend this class or him if you don't need it.",

The final was pretty odd in that there were probably 10 questions that we never learned specifically, but I don't think anyone got them so the curve was pretty steep. A lot of your grade comes down to your GSI's lab scores.",

            "Dr. Olsen is simply an amazing professor. Makes it clear that the course is difficult, but she goes out of her way to help students outside of class. Gets to know almost everyone's names. Picky grader, but definitely fair. Highly recommend 174 over 172, you will learn a lot more and probably get a better grade.", 
            "DONT TAKE BIO 174 WITH HER the reading quiz that is harder then it should be when its just supposed to test if you have done the reading the class would be alright if they rewarded you for all the work you put in but they dont you do and learn 4 times as much as in 172 just take that class get the same grade with less work and knowledge", 
            "She's tough. She is a good lecturer but a harsh grader looking for extremely specific answers. Be careful with re-grades on quizzes because she'll take more points off. Learned a ton in the class, but a lot of reading, reviewing, and studying is required to do remotely well.", 
            "Once she took over, the class became extremely harder. She taught it more like 172 instead of the way 174 is supposed to be taught. Class averages dropped drastically for each quiz",

            "I hated having to take Writing 100 (the most basic writing class available) but Julie was great and I really enjoyed the way she handled the classthe class was too easy IMO but she was very accessible outside of class and just incredibly sweet. One of my favorite profs I've had at the school!", 
            "Julie is a kind & dedicated teacher. She cares a lot about her students & is willing to help outside of class. Lectures were fairly boring, but the papers were graded pretty easily. She is flexible about due dates if the class speaks up about an issue with an assignment. Show that you care & you will get an A! I took Creative Arts & the Community.", 
            "Dr. Babcock is an amazing professor. She made the projects very interesting and engaging. Although she has strict grade, you can definitely success if you seek for help through conference with her and with Sweetland. Sometimes I zoom out in lecture, but it's mandatory. You will get penalty for absence. Homework is mainly for completion grade.", 
            "Although it's a pretty easy class, the lectures didn't help me at all. I don't think I really learned anything, but if you're looking for something to knock your lower level writing requirement out of the way, go for Babcock.",

I wouldn't take a class from her again though. She can't answer your questions to save her life, and she really has these messed up though processes that make no sense.",

            "I was in a research based class of hers and we only had 1 big paper due at the end. It sounds ideal, but when she doesn't teach you to write a research paper it's not. Attendance wasn't necessary bc she doesn't help you with anything. She is very roundabout to her answers and airy. I recommend NOT taking JB.",

Paper comments were insightful, seemed to enjoy teaching, assignments were pretty clear and well developed. Sometimes her responses to questions create more questions, but regardless a great professor",

My grade suffered under his grading bc he was so harsh and didn't really TEACH us how to write. She, on the other hand is a helpful teacher. The class is fun and themed, too!", 
            "She keeps class interesting and when it comes to amount of papers she cares more about quality than quantity so writing them isn't so bad. Definitely one of the better ENG125 classes."

The work is a lot but manageable and actually helps you to learn Spanish. She also speaks Spanish very clearly making her much easier to understand than others", 
            "I went into this class without liking Spanish at all, but by the end of the semester, I actually found it to be one of my favorite classes. Getting an A in Rashmi's class is definitely not easy, but she has a wonderful, enthusiastic personality and creates a great atmosphere for her students. I honestly think I liked 232 because she taught it.",

I finally feel comfortable speaking & have a better understanding- if you actually care about learning the language I recommend!",

He is caring and does not make you feel dumb, and I still felt like I learned a lot without an obscene amount of homework. He calls on students randomly for participation so there is no pressure to be right necessarily -- he likes talking through things and questions students ask.", 
            "Dennis is amazing! Highly recommend this class! He really makes the material interesting and helps you with anything you're struggling with. We only had small assignments and a lot of the time, he pushed back the due dates. If you go to office hours- he'll help you with your homework right there! Oh, and he talks about his wife a lot + tells jokes!", 
            "Denny P is the greatest. He is super nice, knowledgeable, and understanding. He makes his class both easy and very informational at the same time. He has expectations, and if you meet them, he will reward you. He makes everyone feel comfortable and always encourages you. A definite gem of the Spanish department.", 
            "Felt like a high school class. As long as you follow along in class, you'll be totally fine. He calls on people to participate, so you don't have to compete for participation points.", 
            "Dr. Pollard is amazing. Classes revolve around in-class work sheets that help understanding of different grammatical concepts. Quizzes/exams/papers are not very difficult. Pretty easy grader. Super funny and always willing to help. Take any class you can with him!!!", 
            "Felt like a high school class. We did worksheets as a class & for ungraded hw. Puts you on the spot sometimes so you need to pay attention, but he's nice about it and will help you through if you're confused. Very casual teaching, adds humor often. Speaks slowly and writes on board a lot so he's easy to understand. Lots of feedback on papers.", 
            "I took Spanish 289 with Pollard and it was a really great class. It wasn't a difficult class but I still learned a lot.", 
            "He's awesome! Very straightforward, exams are fair, and the homework level is not overwhelming. He's very willing to help when needed and a fair grader as well as a great guy and teacher. Highly recommend taking his class!", 
            "Exams are relatively straightforward and Pollard is super helpful! He tells funny stories in Spanish, which can be a little hard to understand if haven't taken a class all in Spanish before. He works to make sure that everyone participates, which is nice. If you study occasionally, you'll do fine!", 
            "Translation is a great class to take. Pollard is great and the class is really easy but you still get a lot out of it. There are only 2 tests, some assignments throughout the semester, and a final subtitling project. Participation is easy too because he goes around the room and asks everyone questions so you don't have to volunteer.", 
            "Some people think this class isn't as helpful because it's mostly in English, but it is a translation class which, in our case, is always done from Spanish to English. I thoroughly enjoyed this class because it helped me learn more about the Spanish language in ways I hadn't before. Straight forward tests and assignments, good class!", 
            "Dennis was a great prof. He assigns work, but just enough that you really get a grip on the material before the end of the semester. If you show up to class and pay attention you'll do well and he really appreciates a high level of participation. Although the class was taught in English I think that it made me much stronger at communication", 
            "Fantastic professor! I loved all of his classes. Highly recommend him.", 
            "Denny P is awesome! This class is easy, taught in English, and very interesting. You learn a lot about the Spanish language even though it's taught in English. The assignments are easy, the exams are fair, and the final translation doesn't take much time. I would highly recommend this class", 
            "Honestly, this class was by far my easiest at UMICH. I'm a Freshman, and this is probably easier than my high school Spanish. Only a little bit of hw, 3 tests, and a final project (long translation). I would definitely recommend this class if you're looking for an easy A. Pollard is also pretty funny.", 
            "Okay, whoever posted the last bit about this class is clearly an overacheiving allstar. WHO CARES IF THE CLASS IS TAUGH IN ENGLISH?? I actually learned a lot about translating, etc, and Dr. Pollard is an awesome guy. Go out of your way to take his classes because he cares about the material and cares about his students.",

            "Great professor. Makes an effort to be understood by everyone, doesn't give too much homework, and his dry sense of humor is pretty funny. It's not a hard class, but you learn some Spanish if you put in any effort at all.", 
            "This class was really easy. There wasn't much homework. Only 3 graded assignments which were easy translations. The 2 tests were very easy. He's a nice guy, class can be a bit boring at times but laptops are allowed."

            "Dr. Jansen makes his expectations clear for exams. There's a ton of readings, the lectures are dry, and it helps to keep up; however, if you haven't read them before the exam you have hope, just study a couple days in advance for the exam. The paper is GSI dependent so make sure you go to their office hours. Exams are straight forward and easy.", 
            "Make sure you do the readings for this course before every lecture. Go to every lecture since it becomes obvious which things will show up on the 2 exams. Also, for the paper make sure you ask a lot of questions and help from your GSI or else they will grade you poorly on it. Overall, Jansen is well versed and provides a great lecture everyday.", 
            "Tests are basically only over the readings that you do before every lecture, which is a lot of reading. Jansen is passionate about sociology and wants his students to be, too, but the readings get pretty boring and tedious. Otherwise fairly easy class.", 
            "Prof Jansen is a super chill guy, the lectures are pretty average and this class is a super easy A if you make sure to do the readings and study a bit before the exams. 2 exams, 1 paper (on a field study of your choice), and section attendance are the only things you're graded on.", 
            "Jansen is extremely interested in sociology and genuinely cares about his students. There is a decent amount of readings for each lecture, but if you do them and show up to class you'll do just fine. Easiest class so far in my time at Michigan.", 
            "Easy to tell that he is super into what he is talking about which makes the lectures a lot more interesting. A lot of reading but he explains the important aspects of the readings in class. Super funny, nice guy. Easy class, put in the work and you'll be just fine.", 
            "Prof. Jansen was very dedicated and interested in Sociology. He clearly enjoyed teaching and the sociological study students had to complete allowed for real-life application of our class work. His own excitement of the course spread to interested students such as myself and I highly recommend any course with him.", 
            "Fantastic class and easy A! I would definitely recommend Jansen as a teacher. The class is SO straight forward, honestly my easiest class I've taken in 2 years at Michigan. Only catch is you have to read a lot, so don't take it if you're not going to do the readings. The topics of the class are really interesting.", 
            "This class was awful. I hated both the professor and my GSI who might have ruined the entire class for me. The basically mandatory three readings we had to read for each lecture were just the worst. So long and boring. This class could have been condensed into a month but the professor kept droning on. I wanted to shoot myself during lecture.",

The final was a little tricky, you really have to study a lot for the exams. Overall I wouldn't recommend this, psych is a much easier intro.", 
            "Not a sociology person, but I enjoyed his class. He was always trying to engage the students and have them participate in lecture, which was great! However make sure you participate in discussion!!! It is worth 25% of your grade.",

And as stated previously, he is very unclear in lecture- mumbling mostly.",

Even though I did well in the class, none of that came from him as I found him so confusing that I had to study entirely on my own. He also asked random questions unrelated to physiology, such as \"who won this prize?\" on exams.", 
            "Exams are quite difficult, but I must say he knew his stuff and I did learn a lot. I should also note that even with a mediocre grade in the class, I asked him for a letter of rec, and it was one of the easiest and most genuine conversations I've ever had with a professor", 
            "Dr. Hume is by far the worst professor I have had at U of M. I say this even after receiving an A- and working very hard in the course. He is unclear, rude, and teaches at a level not meant for this class. I sincerely regret taking this class while he taught it.", 
            "Dr. Hume is clearly happy to teach this class, and his lectures are interesting. That being said, they're also VERY detailed, contributing to the difficulty of exams. Yes, he did curve an exam, but those towards the top of the curve didn't benefit much. I only gained 8 points back, which doesn't seem fair. Tough to do well, but good class overall!", 
            "He is a really good person, and very knowledgeable. Keeps you attentive in class. However, he should be teaching at grad school. His lectures are a little too advanced for a 200 level course. I would say if you pay attention and ask questions, you will be fine. Also, he curved his exam so well that I gained about 30 points post curve. Good class.", 
            "I feel like he didn't really know how to teach this course. The syllabus says that the grade will be curved at the end\u2026 instead, he curved every exam in a way that wasn't really fair to students in the A/upper B range. He didn't do a great job teaching the concepts either and the exams had trivia questions on them, like questions on Nobel laureates"

            "A pretty boring, yet easy class. Important to go to lecture because that is where 99% of the tested material comes from. Participation in lecture once a class and you're good to go.", 
            "This class wasn't really what I expected, as it was more about modernization theory than comparative politics, but I still found it very interesting. No need to take textbook notes because a lot of it is fluff that won't be tested. The tests are straight forward, but go through the study guides and carefully read through the lecture slides.", 
            "Professor Inglehart is very well-respected in his field and his research is very interesting. The textbook is a bit too much and not necessary. The professor posts slides on canvas but it's hard to concentrate on lectures because he doesnt really speak clearly or loudly. Paper grades are harsh and the logic needs to be detailed to get good grades.", 
            "Don't take this class. Its a 9 am with iclicker attendance, even though he literally reads off the slides and then posts them on canvas. Your grade really depends on your GSI and they're very tough on papers and midterm/finals essays. I get that this guy is a genius in his field, but its not worth it", 
            "I LOVED this class. He ran the class through student presentations, but he was always sure to create a dialogue after presentations where he inserted his own opinion without degrading anyone else's in the class. It was an amazing class; highly recommend to anyone in any major.", 
            "Dr. Inglehart is one of the best in political science. His work is amazing, and I was so lucky to have studied under him. He is brilliant. I loved the class. Must go to lecture. Section is boring, but Chris Skovron is the best GSI for the course.", 
            "Professor Inglehart really cares about his students, he wants everyone to learn through discussion and not through tests. I learned so much and didn't need to ever stress about this class. I highly recommend taking this course.", 
            "Prof. Inglehart is one of the greats in political science. This class opened my eyes as to how other countries work differently (often better) than our own. The readings are long, but not mandatory to succeed. He gives out in-depth study guides for the exams. Study those and you will get an A.", 
            "I really liked this lecture. While it wasn't always incredibly entertaining, the material was interesting and Inglehart was funny. The lectures cover different topics than the readings, so I recommend doing those. Grading really depends on your GSI.", 
            "Inglehart is incredibly intellectual and knows comparative politics extremely well. I found the lectures to be a bit boring and the class to be extremely challenging. It is a lot of information to keep up with but if you have a deep interest in comparative politics, he is an excellent professor.",

I've never seen a class with more student participation and discussion than this class. The man is just a genius in the political science field.", 
            "Inglehart is a huge name in the polisci world and it was a great privilege to take his class. Although lecture is usually pretty dry, he provides interesting and original insight at times that makes attending lecture worth it. Papers and tests are fair, but grade depends on GSI.", 
            "This class has proven to be nothing but a disappointment. I was initially excited to take this class (especially Inglehart's standing in the Political Science field). The boring lectures, miserable GSIs, and tedious papers were only minor factors considering no one learnt anything.", 
            "I was really excited for this class and was somewhat disappointed. He's really well-respected and important in the field, but he's just not an effective lecturer. He started using iClicker this semester but never really explained the policy on that. Your grade is entirely from your GSI. There is triple the information on the final than the midterm.", 
            "This class was extremely boring and disengaging. Ron is definitely well respected in the political science world, but his lecturing is not up to par. His techniques are outdated and staying engaged is a major challenge. The grading seemed unfair and overly harsh. I would not recommend this class.", 
            "Inglehart is one of the worst professors I have had yet. A disgustingly boring lecturer, especially for a 9 AM. He takes attendance through an iClicker 2 minutes before class even begins. He grades absolutely nothing, so hope for a good GSI and make friends. If you're looking for an interesting 100 level course this one is not the one to take.", 
            "Gives a good overview of the political structure of some of the most important countries in the world. Is a good class to get informed about the topic. There are iClicker questions during lectures that are in the exam, so I always went to lecture, although the topic is interesting enough to a polisci major that I would go in any case. Smart guy.", 
            "Professor Inglehart is extremely smart and HUGE within the political science world. This class got repetitive at times but he is a genius and it really wasn't that hard. Though some people say not to go to lectures and just read the slides, I recommend going to lecture because he is smart and also talks more about each slide than he writes"

This was great and inspirational at times, but it also led to her confronting students during discussions in a way that I found inappropriate. Class sometimes felt more like a mindless debate than a discussion about literature. We read great books though. Would take again.", 
            "Prof. Najita was a nice lady who cared deeply about her students and her subjects. The readings were not difficult . Assignments are not terribly hard or confusing either. The group project was stressful but she made the grading criteria rather fair so I think it went well. She made us a Hawaiian dessert on the last day of class, which was nice!", 
            "I left most discussions confused. She tears down any semblance of confidence you have in your ideas and interpretations and expects you to regurgitate back what she can't even clearly explain. Refuses to upload slides to CTools. All assignment guidelines are vague. She's a nice and smart woman but she really didn't teach this class well", 
            "Hesitant about her at first, but our class grew to truly love her. Once you open up to her ideas, she's a very enlightening prof. She always has a bigger picture in mind even when she asks a small question, so if you follow her lead, she'll get to the point in the end, and the journey is worth it.", 
            "Truly awful professor. She'll visibly express her disappointment with you if you don't agree with her ideas & will do so in front of the class. She doesn't know how to encourage students in a fostering way. She ruined my semester and most of all my love for literature. If you have a choice, take another English professor with less of an ego.", 
            "Susan is very passionate about the subject matter, and that translates into her work. She was really willing to meet with me outside of class, and helped me think very differently about the way indigenous view land. She also worked SO hard to bring native Hawaiians to campus for a lecture & hula series. It was so fantastic. She really means well!", 
            "This class was awful. Najita takes an interesting subject and makes it boring and confusing. The readings are long and really hard to understand. Expects a 5pg paper without giving any guidelines and final is a 10 pg collaborative paper that gives no guidelines either. Unclear grading and has no idea what anyone's name is in a 30 person class.", 
            "This course was eye-opening. Professor Najita is truly passionate about Pacific Literature and that comes across in her teaching. Although lectures could be a bit boring at times, this course was pretty easy to get through and I really felt like I learned something at the end of it.", 
            "Had to buy coursepacks and a book which sucked. In this class she expected a collaborative term paper and the process absolutely sucked. Pretty insightful but not very helpful at office hours, you really need to be your own guidance. This class was more of a headache than I expected.", 
            "Susan is super nice and the class is pretty easy, but it is seriously boring! The material that is taught is really dry and hard to stay focused on.", 
            "Very nice and friendly. Maybe a little boring at times, but definitely passionate about the material. I'd recommend her if you're interested in the course material, but it might not be your favorite class if you're not already interested in the topic.", 
            "She's a good teacher, very nice and approachable, and the workload isn't too heavy, grading is fair", 
            "great prof, very nice, very passionate.", 
            "Susan likes people to agree with her, and if you don't, she will hate you. She will also hate you if you are a suck up. She made us write a collaborative/team paper and it was terrible. In the end she gives out good grades, but the class was painful and she was not friendly or at all interested in helping students succeed.", 
            "Very easy class with a nice lady. Tell you what she tells you and you'll get an A. A Pleasant way to spend some time without much effort.",

            "Do NOT take. I went to most classes but because I didn't go to class before thanksgiving I didn't get the extra credit/participation bonus only given that class. Every class is a student led presentation regurgitating info that isn't always correct. She has unclear expectations and when I tried to clarify she cancelled our meeting separate 3 times",

            "Professor Rivers was very nice and everything, but the style her class is taught is very unique. Most of the material is presented via group powerpoints and then she adds on her extra comments at the end of it. Class is fairly easy for the most part but it is imperative to know every single topic since she could pull anything to put on the exam.",

            "I made a huge mistake and took this class because I thought it was going to be an easy A. The class is a whole lot harder than it should be because you are taught by your fellow students on important concepts. When she does try to teach the material, she makes it even more confusing.", 
            "Take this class if you enjoy groupwork and being taught by your fellow students. Lynn is really nice and all, but yikes. This class was awful.

She makes the students do all the teaching, and is incredibly unclear when she does talk in lectures. One of the most boring lecturers I have had. To make it worse, her grading is completely arbitrary and unreasonable.",

Grades seem subjective and when there are only 3 grades in the class that can make a class stressful. I presented a group project in week 2 and was given a grade with no feedback the last week of classes. She posts tons of readings.",

Only plus side is she is very helpful with group presentations - class felt like AP Government but significantly more confusing",

            "It's great that she has first hand experience, but almost everyone failed the first exam so she had to do a HUGE curve. There's no telling what she'll test you on, so only go into this class if you're planning on developing a close relationship with her.",

He has amazing stories too!",

He provides many handouts and good hints to be successful in the class. Hands down best calc prof.",

So much better than the GSI I had before.",

He really goes out of his way to help students. He does make you do homework, but that forces you to at least learn the material. Plus you get more class time",

            "She's a great teacher - I never actually went to lecture, but she does a great job at explaining boring topics in a relatively fun way. Super nice, a little bid odd, but great overall.", 
            "If you have taken any coding class before, Engr 101 will be a breeze. You don't have to show up to the lectures, they are all online. The projects and labs are okay, but at least they make you use concepts that will show up on exams. Also, just you know Prof. Alford REALLY likes Proxima B. Be prepared to see it come up in every project hahahaha...", 
            "Laura was a good professor. She's really nice and all the TechComm professors are also really available to help. The class is easy and if you communicate with the professors and do your work when you have to, you'll do fine. There are three big papers and 2 open-computer exams which are easy if you read the instructions (PUT GENERAL FORMULAS!)", 
            "This has been by far the easiest class I've taken in my life since middle school. Laura is a fun professor who makes CS enjoyable. While I wish she would teach in other ways than just a powerpoint, she tries her best to make the class not boring. Also, she dresses pretty fancy. My nickname for her is Looney Laura. Easy A+ class, seriously.", 
            "Laura's amazing outfits and personality inspired me to come to class even though attendence doesn't count", 
            "Lectures are recorded online so there's no need to come to class. Goes too fast through the material sometimes. When she slows down her explanations are very concise and understandable", 
            "Super enthusiastic lecturer. Content was a little boring & dry but the it's all in the coursepack on Canvas. A little too eager to talk during guest presentations and a little stressed during the ROV competition, but it wasn't too bad. Tests were easy (open internet) but the class itself was somewhat of a time commitment with long but fun labs.", 
            "She lectures off of the coursepack so if you can't understand her, you can at least have that. She often doesn't say what she is looking for in the technical stuff, so ask. But if you actually do the work, you can get an A. If you don't want to spend extra time outside of class on this, don't take it. This is not the easy engr100 section.", 
            "She's definitely a little crazy but she is extremely nice and willing to help in any way she can.", 
            "She's really energetic during lectures and is fun to learn from if you're into that.", 
            "Not a ton of people actually showed up on a regular basis for her ENGR101 class, but she was always entertaining, quirky, and clearly enjoyed teaching us how to program. Her slides are fantastic and all of her lectures are recorded", 
            "Laura was a very energetic teacher who I'm sure is very qualified in her field. However, she was not the best at teaching the given material for this class. Technology rarely worked, she got side tracked more than she stayed on track, and by a third of the way through the semester I stopped attending and looked at the slides which helped much more", 
            "Typical programming class. You can show up to class or not. Doesn't matter either way. Lectures are uploaded online. Easy A", 
            "Amazing !!", 
            "Entertaining lectures, happy to help you outside of class, even if it's not during her normal office hours", 
            "I'm an ME major and had to take ENGR 101 as a prerequisite. I barely had any coding experience before starting this class. The lecture slides are incredibly helpful, Laura has a quirky sense of humor with lots of nerdy references and overall, this is the best structured course I've taken. Very project heavy.", 
            "Laura is absolutely incredible. She's hilarious and explains everything really well. The entire E101 course is run very well, (most) of the GSI's are fabulous too. This is really a great class. Plus the lectures are recorded so you don't physically have to go to lecture if you don't want to!", 
            "The technical material in this class is completely useless but tests aren't too difficult. Be prepared to spend a lot of time in the lab outside of class. Laura often doesn't say what she expects from your reports so make sure to ask questions, otherwise you'll get deducted unfairly. If you want an A, know that every point counts in this class!"
